But we can reduce the number of such cases. The main task of the department is to formulate an annual procurement plan. That is, to minimize an urgent need - when the ministry needs to buy something for the Armed Forces. Previously, this approach affected both quality and product. Therefore, the newly created department must partially resolve this issue, ”said Deputy Minister of Defense Vitaliy Polovenko.</p><p>The Department will form the volume of goods and services required for the purchase of goods and services - in order to satisfy the needs of the needs of logistics forces.</p><p>The Department specialists will explore the market, monitor prices and determine the estimated value. The procurement will be implemented directly by the state operator of the rear.</p></div>
