These missiles were adopted last year.</strong></p><p><span>The President of Russia has repeatedly boasted of the extraordinary capabilities of this "unique" weapon, but there are always a few "buts"...</span></p><h2>What is this missile?</h2><p><span>During development, it was projected as an anti -ship (PCR) of a ship base. "Circon-C 3M22" is part of the 3K22 "Zircon" complex, and the Russians declared the creation of a ground launcher: a stationary complex of coast defense "UTOS", which is also known as "Object-100", or modernized mobile complex of coast defense " Bastion".</span></p><p><span>The development was carried out by specialists of the Moscow "NGO Mechanical Engineering" (relauts of the Moscow region), whose director is Alexander Leonov.</span></p><p><span>This is, in fact, still a Soviet development, which was brought to testing in the early 2000s. The deployment is planned within the framework of the state armament program for 2018</span><span>–</span><span>2027 years.</span></p><p><span>This is a conditionally maneuverable hypersonic cruise missile.</span></p><p><span>Control system: INS + ARLGSN (active radar homing head). Possible types of warhead (BC) - high-explosive, penetrating, nuclear, warhead weight - 300</span><span>–</span><span>500 kg. The main purpose is the overwhelming ships of the enemy of different classes - from frigates to aircraft carriers, as well as its terrestrial military sites.</span></p><p><span>The rocket is launched on the so -called mortar start.</span></p><p><b>Reference.</b><span>A mortar launch (or "cold" start) is a way to start a rocket during which a rocket is ejected from the starting installation or TPK (transport-public container) due to the pressure created in a closed volume by any source located outside the missile .</span></p><p><span>Such a source can be, for example, a powder pressure accumulator (PJSC) or a steam and gas generator. In this case, the rocket engine starts after the rocket leaves the launcher.</span></p><p><span>After the rocket leaves the TPK, the acceleration stage with solid-fuel engines is turned on, which gives primary supersonic acceleration, after which the ramjet engine on liquid fuel (decillin) accelerates it to a speed of 4 M (</span><i><span>M</span></i><span>—</span><i><span>Mach number, Mach is conventionally equal to 340 m/s or 1224 km/h</span></i><span>).</span></p><p><span>Flight height is 30–40 km in the masonic plot, on the terminal area due to dive short -term acceleration up to 7.5 m, closer to the ground due to the air resistance, the speed drops to 4.5 m</span></p><p><span>At such speeds and range of 400-800 km, accurate goal damage is almost impossible today. The components are denoted by the marking 3l22, 3V22, the bolts on the steering mechanisms have a marking in the form of numbers 26.</span></p><p><span>Length (with HF): 8–10 m. Range — from 250 to 500 km at low altitudes and up to 740 km in the case of a semi-ballistic trajectory. When refueling a missile with decillin ("Decillin" (T-10) is a hydrocarbon with the general formula C10H16, used as a high-calorie synthetic aviation fuel), the range can be increased, according to the Russians, to 1 thousand km. Km.</span></p><p><span>In general, the scheme of starting "Zircon" looks like this.</span></p><p><span>After the "mortar" launch and the exit of the rocket from the silo, the acceleration stage begins to work, which ensures the launch of the Zircon to a considerable height and its primary acceleration to speeds at which a hypersonic ramjet engine can begin to operate.</span></p><p><span>Already at its expense, Zircon, flying at an altitude of several tens of kilometers, reaches a constant speed of up to 5.5 m in the marching section of the flight.</span></p><p><span>In the target area, the Zircon begins a dive and briefly accelerates to 7.5 M. At this time, the missile body heats up to the maximum temperatures that a special thermal insulation coating allows it to withstand. At the same time, closer to the ground, the speed of Zircon is no longer hypersonic, although it remains ultra-high — 4.5 M.</span></p><p><span>Consequently, the ZM22 Zircon, as it was believed, does not have hypersonic speed in the final section. But the use of a hypersonic ramjet engine distinguishes it from the Kh-47 Kinzhal, where the missile simply accelerates to such speeds.</span></p><p><span>However, the real combat capabilities of the Zircon are much less than those announced in the Russian Federation. In particular, the leader of the Rashists, Putin, boasted of the speed of the missile up to 9 M, which in reality Zircon does not reach. It is also currently possible to talk about a range of 700 km (in the case of launch from the Object-100), with the declared 1000 km shown by tests at test sites in the Barents Sea.</span></p><h2>What kind of difficulty did developers have?</h2><p><span>The fact is that vehicles that fly at supersonic speed are fundamentally different from devices that fly at hypersonic speed.</span></p><p><span>A conventional turbojet engine loses thrust after triple the speed of sound, which is the main indicator of the efficiency of an aircraft engine. Neither liquid nor solid-propellant jet engines are suitable for such a type of weapon as cruise missiles.</span></p><p><span>The result of scientific and technical searches was a direct-flowing rocket engine capable of operating under the conditions of supersonic combustion. For this purpose, they even developed a new type of Decillin-M rocket fuel with high energy intensity.</span></p><p><span>During the flight of a rocket in airspace at a height of 50-200 meters, the projectile body is heated to high temperatures, so in the manufacture of the product used new heat -resistant alloys.</span></p><p><span>In flight at hypersonic velocity due to the occurrence of a flying projectile, plasma clouds appear natural distortion of target parameters. It was decided to install a radio electronic equipment that can lead a projectile to a target at high speed, despite counteracting powerful electromagnetic fields, but whether it is installed is unknown.</span></p><p><span>This rocket is not unique and invulnerable, because it was knocked down by the Ukrainian military.</span></p><p><span>By the way, in China, such developments are at a rapid pace. Yes, the Chinese anti-ship Rocket DF-21 with a range of up to 3000 km is already in service with the Navy of China. Americans also work on the X-51A X-51 Wave Rider project, whose developer is Lockheed Martin Corporation (2010 development). Hypersonic winged rocket, 7–8 m speed, 30 km in height, should start from terrestrial, marine and air media. The range is 2000 km, but most data are closed.</span></p></div>
