In the old procurement system, all power was concentrated in the ministry. For example, the purchase of the rear property was fully engaged in the Department of Resource Support - here they calculated the expected cost of purchases, and communicated with market participants, and directly conducted bidding.</p><p>The concentration in one hand of these functions was the main risk of possible corruption, said the Head of the Procurement Policy Department.</p><p>To get rid of it, the Ministry of Defense has abandoned the direct function of the purchaser, passing it on two specialized agencies.</p><p>"In the new procurement system, the Ministry has only reserved the function of policy development, that is, establishing rules and quality control," said Gleb Kanevsky.</p><p>The procurement of rear property is now engaged in the State Rear Operator. This agency has already gone for bidding through the ProZorro system and purchases clothing, bulletproof vests, helmets, fuel and lubricants for the Armed Forces.</p><p>Weapons and ammunition purchases the Defense Agency. Agency recently<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/05/minoborony-vpershe-prydbaye-cherez-systemu-prozorro-20-tys-bezpilotnykiv/">She first announced</a>Due to the ProZorro system, the purchase of 20,000 unmanned aviation complexes (BPAC) with a total expected value of almost UAH 3 billion (excluding VAT).</p><p>In order to improve the control of the procurement, the Ministry of Defense initiated the creation of supervisory boards in agencies, the head of the procurement policy department added. “Defense Agency”<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/06/agencziya-oboronnyh-zakupivel-rozpochala-proczes-stvorennya-naglyadovoyi-rady/">announced</a>Selection of a recruiting company that will help to choose independent members of the Supervisory Board.</p><p>In particular, its competence will be the formation of anti -corruption policy and the appointment and termination of powers of the head of the internal audit unit. It is prepared for the start of selection of a recruiting company and a "state operator of the rear", said Gleb Kanevsky.</p><p>In addition to a working meeting with NATO Agency for Support and Procurement, the Ministry of Defense representatives held meetings dedicated to the topics of the Council of Ukraine-Ukraine (with NATO Operational Department), Civil Supervision of the Army (with NATO International Military Staff), USA.
