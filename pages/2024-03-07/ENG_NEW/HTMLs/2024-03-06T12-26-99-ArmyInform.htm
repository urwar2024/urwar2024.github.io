Moreover, according to research on Freedom House, with headquarters in Washington, today more than two billion people suffer from the oppression of despotic power.</strong></p><p>According to Freedom House, there are now over 100 dictatorships or partial dictatorships in the world.</p><p>In 2023, the level of global freedom decreased again. This has been happening for the 18th consecutive year due to armed conflicts and more and more election fraud.</p><p>Currently, only 20% of the countries of the world consider American analysts completely free, and 38% of countries live in partly free, and 38% of countries live under constant attacks on the rights and freedoms of citizens.</p><p>For example, in more and more Africa, dictators come to power through a coup. In 2023, Niger and Gabon became the sixth and seventh countries on the continent after Burkin-Faso, Chad, Guinea, Mali and Sudan, in which a coup was held since 2020.</p><p>Not only revolutions, but also coup leaders, which are increasingly expressing solidarity with each other, which further contributes to the destruction of democratic norms.</p><p>The events of 2023 also emphasized the fact that wars could spread far beyond the borders of hostilities, because the leaders of authoritarian countries such as Russia or China encourage other dictatorships for such acts.</p><p>Dictatorship is evil. And in Ukraine it is not easy to break out of the tenets of evil. Dictators, as the world experience shows, end badly, because they use the same tools that they enjoyed themselves over time.</p><p>The armyinform has prepared a short rating of dictators of the past, who died not by their death, but the most odious dictators of today, who have every chance to repeat the same fate.</p><p><strong>Adolf Hitler</strong>- 56 years old, Fuhrer Germany.
