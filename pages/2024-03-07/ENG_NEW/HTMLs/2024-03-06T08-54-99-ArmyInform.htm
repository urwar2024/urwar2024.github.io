Which country helped us to implement this course? But what is a "result system"? The answers were answered by the Army Correspondent.</strong></p><h2>“We teach people how to make a program”</h2><p>- The course lasts 10 days: 8 days of educational and 2 - administrative, - says the head of the course of preparation of the instructor of academic level Dmitry.</p><p>According to him, the course is based on the Systems Approach Training system:</p><p>- This is a system, let's just say, achievement. It is based on writing programs, drawing up standards in the Army of Canada, the United States. Specifically, the US has the Corps of Marines.</p><p>Dmitry emphasizes that the mentioned system involves avoiding excessive learning. It involves learning because it is really necessary, provides maximum efficiency at a minimum cost.</p><p>- That is, in this course we teach people how to make a program. To study the people who need it now and have studied - in the minimum time, - adds the course manager.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-548225" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-06T08-54-99/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-06T08-54-99/000001.jpg" width="1500"/><p>The system itself involves the participation of both sergeants and officers, generals.</p><p>- Everyone plays a role when writing a program. The sergeant can be a consultant. Maybe a soldier to participate. If it is a soldier with combat experience, he will also be a consultant during the program.</p><p>The officer will be, for example, the leader of the group. And the highest commander can make some requirements for writing this program. At the sergeant level, we give the basic principles of Systems Approach Training in 8 days, - said Dmitry.</p><h2>"Thanks to Canadians, we have translated into Ukrainian a lot of teaching materials"</h2><p>In the course, sergeants train programs, conduct a number of lessons, and at the outlet understand and know how to make a standard, how to make a program.</p><p>They know how to make a training program based on the real needs of today, how to change the program, how to make educational material, how to evaluate.</p><p>Dmitry says such a course appeared because our country wants to join NATO. And most Alliance programs include the use of Systems Approach Training.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-548226" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-06T08-54-99/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-06T08-54-99/000002.jpg" width="1500"/><p>- Canada, the United States use Systems Approach Training. And we must be compatible with partner countries,-explains the course head.</p><p>The very concept of the development of the sergeant, the instructor staff implies that the higher level sergeant should understand why the learning happens that way.</p><p>-That is, the sergeant will not just take the training program and read, but he must understand why, for example, in this course, so many hours for this subject, so many hours for this. And in general, why this subject is present in this course, and on the other - there is no such subject, - Dmitry notes.</p><p>He recalls that Canadian officers assisted this course.</p><p>- There is, of course, one problem that I cannot help but voice is English. But our sergeants continue to teach it, and we, thanks to the Canadians, have translated many educational materials in Ukrainian, - said the head of the training instructor of the academic level.</p><p><em>Photo by the author</em></p></div>
