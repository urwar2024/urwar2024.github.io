The bill is good for buying weapons, but it should be done. The bill can not be fighting, \u201dsaid Josep Borrel.</p><p>According to him, the purpose of the European Union is to increase defense production and to put 1.1 million shells in general by the end of the year.</p><p>At the same time, he stressed that there is another source of supply to consider, these are direct contracts between Ukraine and the European industry.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows the exact numbers there. But I think I can take the courage to say that more than 350,000 ammunition was put in Ukraine through this channel, \u201dsaid Josep Borrel.</p><p>He called on the EU Member States to respond faster to Ukraine's needs.</p><p>\u201cI hope that by the end of the year we will go to the level of 1 150,000 shells. This is still not enough, but it is much more than we could expect at the beginning, \u201dadded the head of European diplomacy.</p><p>As reported by the Armyinform, March 5th European Commission<a href=\"https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/05/yes-predstavyv-pershu-oboronno-promyslovu-strategiyu-peredbachaye-tisnu-spivraczyu-z-ukrayinoyu/\">presented</a>The first European defense-industrial strategy in history, which involves active cooperation with Ukraine.</p></div>", "source": "https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/06/ukrayini-potribno-200-tysyach-snaryadiv-shhomisyaczya-yes-maye-reaguvaty-shvydshe-zhozep-borrel/", "title": "Ukraine needs 200 thousand shells monthly, the EU should respond faster - Josep Borrel", "description": "This was stated by the High EU Representative on Foreign Affairs and Safety Policy of Josep ...", "author": ["Army Inform"], "categories": ["\u0412\u0430\u0436\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e", "\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438"], "tags": ["\u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0432", "\u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u044e\u0437", "\u0416\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043f \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044c"]}
