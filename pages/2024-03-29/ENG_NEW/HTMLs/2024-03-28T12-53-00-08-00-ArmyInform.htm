What is your opinion about this?</strong></p><p>- I will start with what I said earlier - there is no alternative to mobilization, since it is the only legitimate way to preserve and build up the combat capabilities of defense forces at a level that guarantees the repeling of the Russian occupier. The enemy contrary to the laws of war, but also common sense, the religious canons of each of the world religions throughout the clock, throws new and new forces around the clock, does not count with any loss, trying to please Putin's dictator and come out in the near future at least administrative border Lugansk, Donetsk regions.</p><p>Therefore, our defense forces need not only complementing but also rotation. The legislative activity of the Committee is aimed at preserving a democratic basis during the war and to offer citizens the opportunity to choose the way to fulfill the requirements of Article 65 of the Constitution, which defines the obligation of Ukrainian citizens to protect the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The first method is recruiting, that is, through voluntary conclusion by a person with a detention contract. The second way is because of a summons from the CCC. There are no other options.</p><p><strong>- How much do you think the recruiting system to the Armed Forces will be able to help quality conscription?</strong></p><p>- The recruiter system was conceived as the basis of the Armed Forces before the Great War of the Russian Federation against Ukraine in 2022. The main arguments in favor of such a decision were that the army was completed on a voluntary basis in accordance with a conscious independent decision, aspirations, qualifications and capabilities of the person, his desire to realize himself in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In this way, it was planned to accelerate the introduction of NATO standards, in particular personnel management, filling the entire contract term solely with improving professional skills and preventing the manifestations of relapses of Soviet region, when combat training was replaced by the performance of economic work.</p><p>The whole course of the large -scale war only confirmed the correctness of such a decision. After all, even such a cruel and bloody aggressor as the Russian Federation, which had the advantage of the forces and means, prompt initiative for their use, was unable to break the resistance and defeat the highly motivated, patriotic -minded Ukrainians and Ukrainian women, which tens of thousands, since February 2022, voluntarily. They replenished the defense forces and stood up for Ukraine.</p><p>Therefore, we consider recruiting not only as the most perfect and effective form of conscription, completing the defense forces, but also as an increase in the capabilities of each military unit, the main condition for maintaining, creating and cultivating glorious combat traditions, maintaining law and order, forming a new generation of command composition of different levels.</p><p><strong>- But some experts say that the army should fight, and recruiting issues, they say, should be engaged in other structures.</strong></p><p>- Ideally, probably, if the war did not prevent the introduction of a full system of accounting for military personnel, to bring to the full capacity of the Tax Code, the information campaign for recruitment.</p><p>However, the realities of the war require current challenges and threats in such a way as to win the enemy, and in this response we came to the fact that the brigades launched our own recruiting campaign. During their existence, they have proven themselves positively. Therefore, I think it is not necessary to give up this form in favor of another that has not yet been created.</p><p>In addition, in NATO countries, the authorized structures of species and troops also carry out their own powerful information recruiting campaign to involve potential specialists in military service, focus on motivational packages that are trying to unify with the proposals of commercial structures.</p><p>In my opinion, the involvement of military units in the recruiting process is such a new form of civil control over a military organization. After all, it is on the basis of why some units stand for those who want to and others have a critical attitude that you can promptly draw conclusions and take personnel measures.</p><p>Please note that the negative of Ukrainians is not the demanding of commanders or a difficult training process of combat training or military service itself, and above all - a violation of the period of preparation before sending to the advanced, its saturation with combat training.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are some cases that are related to the lack of professional skills of some commanders of different levels in the management of subordinate personnel, communication style, responding to the difficulties of military existence of subordinates, etc.</p><p><strong>- What should be done to make the recruiting system further spread?</strong></p><p>- First of all, it is a guaranteed fulfillment of the terms of the contract, and primarily on the issues that I spoke above - the term, the content of the preparation, the level of security, the conditions of military service, the receipt of the military service.</p><p>Secondly, it is a daily won the battle for people's trust, the trust that the military department, the deputy corps, respond in a timely manner and draw the right conclusions from every problem that has been made for objective or subjective reasons in a particular unit.</p><p>We live in conditions where the enemy constantly forms anti -Ukrainian reality, plays fakes about the situation at the front, mobilization and other measures taken to strengthen our defense capability.</p><p>These are realities that cannot be ignored and which require constant improvement of communication with society, conscripts.</p><p>In this process, the role of commanders, representatives of units, who can more actively participate in interviews with potential recruiters, meetings, speeches in the media, and thus remove warnings of military service, their families against military service.</p><p>It should be remembered that we will not say about one or another problem, especially that has become widespread on social networks, instantly tell the enemy with anti -Ukrainian rhetoric, or think of an average citizen at his discretion.</p><p>Third, there should be films, books, socio-political, and cultural measures on the state, which are designed to keep the authority of military service and military uniform at the highest level. We have only a culture to pass the military in queues, and during a meeting on the streets, in public places-to express the words of gratitude for military service.</p><p><strong>- The second version of the mobilization bill has been considered in the Committee since early February. In your opinion, when and in what form can it be transferred to the Verkhovna Rada?</strong></p><p>- The duration of consideration is due not only to the number of editions, the number of which exceeds four thousand, but also their scale, that is, the number of legislation they touch. In addition, the amendments are considered with the participation of representatives of social groups whose interests affect these amendments. To date, more than 3518 edits have already been considered.</p><p>The severity of the discussion is that all participants in the consideration of amendments refer to their own 2 years of experience of mobilization during a full-scale Russian-Ukrainian war, and it, unfortunately, does not always contain a positive assessment. For example, in some regions, close cooperation of local authorities and CCCs is maintained, in others - on the contrary, it is absent, which has a negative effect on mobilization processes.</p><p>There were no less acute discussions when the question of what category and why should be reservated.</p><p>In general, everyone is aware of the need to strengthen the defense forces, but not everyone is ready to divide responsibility for extremely unpopular decisions and to recognize the priority of Article 65 of the Constitution, which defines the duty of the country's citizens to protect Ukraine's independence and territorial integrity.</p><p>In view of the above, it is difficult to predict which of the drafting of the draft law after consideration by the Committee will remain and which will be excluded or modified.</p><p>With regard to the terms of presentation of the document in the Verkhovna Rada, I think it will be the middle of April, given the legal examination of the apparatus of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.</p></div>
