The same story is repeated now, during the large -scale war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.</strong></p><p>So, our state has these history lessons to learn: to strengthen the army with motivated people, to take care of its own information hygiene and to eliminate all the tentacles, which the Kremlin also leads hybrid aggression in Ukraine.</p><p>So says Candidate of Political Science, historian, religious scientist, political scientist, officer of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Andriy Kovalev.</p><p>The officer told about the enthusiasm of Ukrainians at the beginning of a large -scale invasion of the army at the beginning of a large -scale invasion at the beginning of a large -scale invasion. This is the first part of our conversation with the military:</p><h2>“I am a rare case where a military-accounting specialty coincides with the post”</h2><p>“On the eve of a large -scale invasion, about a month or two, my wife said there would be a war. I replied that it was a panic mood, and there would be no war, and Putin would not dare to start large -scale aggression. Because in all the ratios it would be a shot of myself for the Russian Federation.</p><p>By education, I am a political scientist, a candidate of political sciences, so in such conclusions relied on a political analysis of the international situation. Yes, I understood that the Russians would threaten nuclear weapons, "recognize" the occupied territories, include them in the Russian Federation, but a large -scale war, so I thought it would not be.</p><p>While my wife was collecting a alarming suitcase, in the meantime, for two weeks, invitations to TV channels as a political expert were painted in advance.</p><p>And even on February 24, I, as a disciplined responsible person, went on two ether (laughs). And after television, he was photographed against Sofia of Kiev, published a photo, signing it: "I stay."</p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-558114 size-full" height="960" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-28T07-38-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-28T07-38-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" width="1280"/><p>Before that, in January, the Law on National Resistance was voted. Many of my friends began to sign contracts with Taroboron. And I also began to look for a battalion TRO. One of the commanders replied that I came to them, told them to come with the documents. I brought the whole kit except for a criminal record. I proposed to generate it through action. But it, as it turned out, still comes in two weeks.</p><p>So, the commander opened the calendar and assigned me to meet in two weeks. It was 9am on February 24, 2022. And on February 24, I called and said that he was ready, in principle, to come (laughs). But the commander advised to go to the management of the team.</p><p>I was a younger lieutenant, I won the officer at the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. My military accounting specialty is an information and propaganda provision of army.</p><p>Subsequently, colleagues joked that I was a rare occasion when a military accounting specialty coincides with the position (laughs).</p><p>I asked one major, "How many of us?" He replied that 400. I thought that 400 thousand in 5 million Kiev was decent ... But he specified that we were only 400 people in the brigade. That's when I was not on my own.</p><p>Subsequently, the commander ordered to join the crew of the brigade. I asked: how to unfold? To which he received the answer: "You will go outside now, and you will understand everything."</p><p>I go out to the porch - and I feel on the stage of the concert of the band "Ocean Elsa". I stood in front of me a sea of people: to the left, on the right ... just a sea of people. It was February 24.</p><div class="fotorama--wp" data-auto="false" data-captiontag="dd" data-columns="0" data-icontag="dt" data-ids="558116,558117,558119" data-itemtag="dl" data-link="file" data-max-width="100%" data-ratio="1.3333333333333" data-size="large" data-width="1280"><div class="gallery galleryid-557485 gallery-columns-0 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-1"><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-28T07-38-00-08-00/000002.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-28T07-38-00-08-00/000002.jpeg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-28T07-38-00-08-00/000003.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-28T07-38-00-08-00/000003.jpeg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon portrait"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-28T07-38-00-08-00/000004.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-28T07-38-00-08-00/000004.jpeg" width="150"/></dt></dl></div></div><p>The wide -mentioned avenue is filled with people - and they have no end and edge. As soon as they saw us, they began to shout: "Give a weapon!" We replied that we do not give weapons, but mobilize to the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p><p>After these words, some people dispersed and some remained. People began to self -organize: they created their mouths, chose their mouth, and divided into platoons. We planted them on buses, brought them into battalions.</p><p>In those days, I realized that in any incomprehensible situation, Ukrainians began to build Zaporizhzhya Sich: they began to dig trenches, pulled bags from somewhere, filled them with sand, made barricades. There was a constant movement around. In my eyes, people built Zaporizhzhya Sich.</p><h2>Did not this enthusiasm go out from the Ukrainians - to build Zaporizhzhya Sich - for two years of a large -scale war?</h2><p>I began to feel that there was such a mood from people that we had already won when we rejected the Muscovites from Kiev, from Kyiv and Chernihiv, when people began to return from evacuation. After one business trip to the east, I returned to Kiev. And I realized that I was driving from one city, and I returned to a completely different dimension. I was shocked: where is the time machine where I missed this portal?</p><p>Then there were some mixed feelings: on the one hand, we need to return to a peaceful lifestyle, and on the other, we have never encountered that. We are not a hybrid war, not a conflict within one area or one area. It is a large -scale aggression when you cannot feel safe anywhere, because the whole territory of Ukraine is fired ...</p><p>And Ukrainians are the world Olympic champions to adapt to new circumstances: we have learned to live in the conditions of war and restrictions that we impose martial law. And we must admit that Ukrainians are strong when they go beyond the comfort zone.</p><h2>"A contract system with transparent rules of the game is what can help us"</h2><p>With regard to the current situation with mobilization, it seems to me that it is currently needing an honest dialogue with society. On the occasion of Volunteer's Day, there were the following words in the address of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: "Ukraine exists as long as those who are ready to defend it." This is the base. These words should be written on billboards. And this is what every Ukrainian needs to be aware of.</p><p>But, in my personal opinion, we may need to come to the practice of contracts: a year or two. If you think as a manager, what do we have? There is a target audience - those who have not yet found their place in the defense of Ukraine.</p><p>Definitely - Ukraine needs mobilization and new people. Because there are military people who have been fighting for 10 years, and for many of them it has become a way of life, a habit.</p><p>In addition, technologies should also come into assistance to Ukraine. We are leading a war that no country has waged. We wage a war with a country where 140 million people live.</p><p>They are actually a powerful staff reserve, and therefore, the mobilization resource - as we would like to do so. Even an unobtrusive person with a machine gun is always much more dangerous than just an unobtrusive person. Even an unobtrusive person with a stick is much more scary than just a person. As they say, a good word and gun do more than just a good word.</p><p>So, theoretically, we are opposed to 140 million katsaps with sticks (at least) or with automatic machines.</p><h2>“100 years ago, our predecessors lost statehood. And we have a chance to prevent those mistakes "</h2><p>I very often give examples historical. So: 100 years ago, our predecessors lost statehood. And we have a chance to prevent those mistakes.</p><p>So, 100 years ago, one of the reasons for the victory of the Russian Federation over Ukraine was that Russia simply threw Ukraine with corpses. We were not able to grind the number of katsaps that they had thrown here, the Russians had simply a bottomless mobilization resource.</p><p>Yes, the UNR performed mobilization, but first, this mobilization was insufficient. And secondly, you should not forget that international sanctions were imposed against the UNR. This was not fashion about it, but against us France, the United Kingdom has imposed sanctions, because, according to the countries of the former Entente, we were opponents, signing a peace treaty with the Triple Alliance. And our allies became Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, Bulgaria-who were opponents of the Entente.</p><p>The Entente was regarded as the UNR chose for her enemies. But the Entente did not hear us in our struggle for independence, and supported our enemies - white Russian chauvinists who wanted to restore the Russian Empire.</p><p>So in 1919 we did not have international support. Petliura launched a powerful cultural diplomacy, it was a super -manager project, but it did not save the situation. In 1919, Ukraine purchased weapons, uniforms, medicines, but they also remained in Romania on the railway, in echelons, as "sub -". And Ukraine has received almost nothing.</p><p>And we need to learn these lessons. Yes, now we have international support, but in a hundred years Russia has not invented anything new, and they are fighting with us the same methods: they throw in corpses, lead information war, propaganda against us.</p><h2>"I advise my friends not to stick on social networks - and they change in a week"</h2><p>The Ukrainians 100 years ago "went to Russian propaganda and populism: Lenin came up with the most simple populist slogans:" soldiers - peace, factories - workers, peasants - land. " And he was deceived because no one got anything. The soldiers received not peace, but a new war. The workers did not receive their factories, the peasants did not receive land. But everyone went to it because it was a supergly that everyone liked.</p><p>What is going on now? Russian propaganda launches absolutely simple and false slogans - and Ukrainians believe them. They are more willing to believe anonymous telegrams, but do not believe their own power. They will spread any rumors - and in this we are also the world Olympic champions.</p><p>But we need to understand that through these rumors, the enemy leads an offensive not only on the Avdiivsky, Kupyansky or Novopavlovsky direction. It keeps a constant offensive in the information direction. Ukrainians just need to learn the basic rules of information hygiene. This is vital.</p><p>If you have psychological irritation, insomnia, pathological fear, and you can not explain the nature of this - therefore, you are informationally infected. I advise my friends to put less on social networks - and people change in a week.</p><p>They are healing! They simply do not know about the existence of srans that are carved on the network.</p><p>About the new Russian information special operations, I sometimes find out from my mom who calls me and asks if it is true. And I understand that the Russian Ipsius got to mom.</p><p>I am a political scientist, Candidate of Political Science. He had a little experience in the election, and once one of my teacher said: "You will win when your agitau is lying in every house in your district." Remember, once in every rural house hung a calendar "Tigul"? The recognition of this policy was at an altitude.</p><p>So, when Russian IPSO enters every house - we have a panic in the rear, despair, fright. Accordingly, there are no want to go to the armed forces - this is what Russian IPSO is converted into.</p><p>About why it must be studied to victory over Russia, to "spread on particles"; Why Ukraine should strive for the collapse of the aggressor state; Why "Sergei Shoiga" is a fiction; In which Republic of the Russian Federation is the highest level of Russophobia in all Russia, as well as about many other things - read in the second part of Andrei Kovalev's interview for the Armyinform.</p></div>
