At the same time, they are not very modern, although the enemy is working on modernizing them, bringing them to the level of the X-32 and so on. And this is not the first time that moments have been recorded when they have some troubles in the air. In all likelihood, the same situation could have happened," Nataliya Humeniuk replied.</p><p>At the same time, she noted that the Defense Forces are currently clarifying the consequences of this attack.</p><p>"But we understand that by entering from the Black Sea, the enemy tried to attack the southern regions of the Odesa region," Natalia Humeniuk emphasized.</p><p>As reported by the Armyinform, for<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/28/znyshheno-26-iz-28-shahediv-u-povitryanyh-sylah-povidomyly-detali-vidbytyh-atak-rf/">data of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine</a>, on the night of March 28, 2024, the enemy struck a rocket and aviation strike in Ukraine with the use of three winged X-22 missiles and an anti-radiolocation missile X-31P (from the Black Sea), anti-aircraft managed missile C-300 (Donetsk) and 28 shock UAPs Type ShahED-136/131 (Kursk region-RF., Cape Chauda-Crimea).</p></div>
