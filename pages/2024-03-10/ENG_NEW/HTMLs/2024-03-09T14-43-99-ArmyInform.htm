In general, two rations are widespread in the Armed Forces. This is the 10th and 15th norm. These rations are very different. The fact is that the 10th norm is mostly composed of canned food and is issued for several days. And, here are the 15th-they are fully ready-made dishes for our military, ”Vitaliy Polovenko said.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;"><div style="margin: 20px 0; margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 8px 20px 10px; background: #f1f1f1; border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.15); box-shadow: 0 5px 10px rgba(0,0,0,.3); font-size:15px; border-radius: 8px;">The 15th field set includes 14 types of menu with full meals. For example: borscht, soups, various porridge with meat and vegetables, coffee, tea, honey, jam, rrium breadcrumbs and wheat. The energy value of one diet should be at least 3500 calories.</div></p><p style="font-weight: 400;">“That is, these two field kits have virtually different purpose. If the military goes on a business trip for several days, the 10th norm will be enough. However, if the military is performing the appropriate tasks and for several weeks outside the PPD, they definitely require the 15th norm. Unfortunately, there is a situation where some fighters are offered exclusively 10, ”Vitaliy Polovenko said.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the Deputy Minister of Defense emphasized that the last purchase of the 15th norm was held at the end of 2022. The whole party was removed because of the mismatch of laboratory requirements.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">“It is important that the servicemen have both norms of field sets. Subsequently, it is planned to move away from canned and feed our defenders and defenders with full -fledged dishes. After all, we are clearly aware that quality and safe food of the military is also a guarantee of our safety! Therefore, the Logistics Forces Command should organize dry rations and as soon as possible to form the need for the purchase of the 15th ration. When the Ministry of Defense receives this need, the state operator will be purchased, ”the Deputy Minister of Defense said.</p><p>As reported by the Armyinform, to provide an Armed Forces with food<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/08/dlya-zabezpechennya-zsu-harchuvannyam-dot-ukladatyme-dogovory-z-postachalnykamy-bez-prozorro/">DOT will conclude contracts with suppliers</a>without a window.</p></div>
