If you have received a summons or have already passed the medical commission and have been informed of the date of departure to the troops, then you should start collecting the necessary things.</strong></p><p><strong>The summons for sending is usually written that you need to take. But is everything you need? From my personal experience, I was told (and not just me) in the shopping center that a lot of things do not need to be taken. Everything will be issued. In fact, there are quite a few things that will be needed. And they will not be issued. Or not in the amount you need.</strong></p><h2>That is issued</h2><p>There is a basic set that is issued to servicemen - BEK (combat single set). It has 46 positions. We will not list absolutely all points. The full list of what should be published can be found in<a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/z0767-16#Text" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Defense Minister No. 232</a>. During the martial law, we are interested in norm 1, category 5 (wearing time).</p><p><strong>Personal protective equipment</strong></p><p>Helmet, bulletproof vest and ballistic glasses. All this is issued for 2 years. There should also be 3 covers to the helmet.</p><p><strong>Footwear</strong></p><p>Berzi is summer or demi -season, winter, slippers, shoe covers and rubber boots. One couple for 2 years.</p><p><strong>Uniform</strong></p><ul><li>Suit (boiler and pants). 2 sets for 2 years. Extra pants are also issued once a year.</li><li>Fisk. One for 2 years.</li><li>Winter jackets and pants. One species for 2 years.</li><li>Fighting shirt (UBAX). Two for 2 years.</li><li>Polo shirt. Two for 2 years.</li><li>Demi -season and winter gloves. Paired for 1 year.</li><li>Bafi (in the army it is called a scarf). Summer and winter.</li></ul><p><strong>Hats</strong></p><p>The hat is common and winter, Kashket and Panama.</p><p><strong>Equipment</strong></p><p>Karemate, sleeping bag, tactical gloves, belt, transport bag.</p><p><strong>Whiteness</strong></p><p>T -shirts, winter and summer socks, pants, 2 sets of thermal underwear - demi -season and winter.</p><p>If something is lost because of the fighting, then you have to give you new. But there is an important point. About the loss/destruction of the property immediately inform the commander so that it can be written off. The new form will be issued only after that.</p><h2>That will not be given but better to have with you</h2><p>Immediately I note that the above described is not an axiom, but only my own experience. Everyone should choose what they really need and what is financial capacity.</p><p><strong>Documents</strong></p><p>Passport, driver's license, duplicate of the individual tax number, military documents. And it is important to keep it all in a special waterproof package.</p><p><strong>What is required for personal hygiene:</strong></p><ul><li>toothpaste, brush (preferably several), shampoo, soap, toilet paper;</li><li>shaving machine or electricity (even if you plan to release your beard, it is also necessary to look after it);</li><li>towel;</li><li>manicure scissors;</li><li>sunscreen (you are unlikely to get to the beach, but you will have to be often in the sun, so burns are quite possible);</li></ul><ul><li>Washing powder or washing capsules if there is a washing machine. But usually people in training centers are many, and washing machines are not. Therefore, you will have to wash your hands. And already in the part, especially if the service passes directly on the line of contact, or next to it, it is not necessary to count on the washing machine at all;</li><li>Wet wipes - a universal remedy for all occasions (almost like adhesive tape. Scotch, by the way, is also worth taking).</li></ul><p><strong>Electrical appliances:</strong></p><ul><li>Verbank;</li><li>extension cord/tee (charge a phone or other gadgets often, and there is always a lack of space);</li><li>flashlight.</li></ul><p><strong>Shoes are one of the most important aspects</strong></p><p>In the shoes you will spend most of the day under completely different weather conditions. Therefore, it should be perfect in size, but not desirable, but already dispersed. Yes, shoes in the army appear. But there may be questions with the required size. In addition, sooner or later, it will become strongly contaminated or wet. And you will need something to replace. So it is better to have something extra.</p><p><strong>Preferably:</strong></p><ul><li>Sneakers/trekking boots;</li><li>Rubber slippers.</li></ul><p><strong>If possible:</strong></p><p>- demi -season Berzi;</p><p>- additional insoles (shoes wear out quickly and insoles even faster).</p><p><strong>Clothes</strong></p><p>Here the situation is similar to shoes. The form is issued. But again, they may not be issued immediately. In addition, some things can wear out quite quickly due to load. For example, some of my form did not even survive before completing my studies. Although I know many people who at least have enough for what they were issued.</p><p><strong>But if possible, it is better to have:</strong></p><p>- set of form (pants and boiler);</p><p>- T -shirts, linen, socks;</p><p>- Flisk (personally, I was enough for a long time, which was issued, however, the conditions are different, so it is also advisable to have another one if possible);</p><p>- tactical gloves (an important thing in the army - hands constantly have to do something, so it is better to have protection);</p><p>- a set of civilian clothes.</p><p><strong>Backpack or Baul</strong></p><p>Baul or some big bag will be issued. But this is mostly used as a dresser that stores things. Therefore, it is better to have:</p><p>- backpack, at least 30 liters;</p><p>- Packages and bags that will not be superfluous.</p><p><strong>Equipment</strong></p><p>The main equipment is issued. But you may need a lot. Initially, I would advise not to break my head about it. First, you need to see what they will give. Much depends on what part and what position you will be distributed.</p><p><strong>Different</strong></p><ul><li>The dishes that do not beat.</li><li>Needles, threads.</li><li>Rope and rootstock to dry clothes after washing.</li><li>Multitulus. I do not know how to live without him before. You must constantly twist, unscrew, clamp, cut. Replaces a large enough set of tools.</li><li>Carbines. It is not necessary to have a lot, but at least it is advisable to have a couple. There is always something that is better to touch the armor than to wear in your hands or in a backpack.</li><li>Matches/lighters.</li><li>Super glue.</li></ul><p><strong>Aid kit</strong></p><p>The load on the body increases significantly. Therefore, without slaughter, back and joint pain is unlikely to go through this path. In addition, if people begin to get sick, then at the stage of training centers. In general, the necessary help should be provided at the health center. But in different training centers the situation with medical care is different. Somewhere better, somewhere worse. Therefore, you should collect the first aid kit at home. What to take:</p><ul><li>thermometer;</li><li>painkillers and antipyretics;</li><li>drugs in the case of gastric disorders;</li><li>bandage, cotton wool, antiseptic drugs;</li><li>adhesive plaster, elastic bandage.</li></ul><p>And you should not worry if you have forgotten. Usually there are post offices. Therefore, relatives will be able to send what is missing.</p></div>
