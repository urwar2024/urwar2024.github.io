And each gun has a name that traditionally gives it a comha. This D-20 is called "Marina".</p><p>Recently it was she who helped the infantry units to knock the enemy out of Krasnogorivka:</p><p>- We need to talk to her weapon, she listens. Although it is metal, it also feels. Believe it, there were times when you say to her, "Little, well, they should be charged" - and in fact clearly hit.</p><p><em>Photo by the author</em></p></div>

Donetsk resident, in 2014 he was forced to leave his home and move to Sumy.</p><p>Ruslan's mother is a native of Sumy region, from Bilopillya, so he seemed to move from one small homeland to another within a single Ukraine.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549242" height="853" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000001.jpeg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000001.jpeg" width="1280"/><p>The arrangement in a new place took for a while, but the man did not leave the desire to repay the enemy for a forced expulsion. The best option, in his opinion, was the service in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p><h2>Instead of being a “boar” decided to become a soldier</h2><p>The first attempts by Ruslan Avtonov to join the ranks of the Ukrainian army were unsuccessful, did not help even previous experience in the State Security Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine.</p><p>- At that time, it was problematic for natives of Ukraine to get to the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, - Ruslan recalls. - In 2014, some forms and documents of the military commissariats and other state authorities of Ukraine from Donetsk and Luhansk regions came into the hands of the enemy. This fact further complicated the already critical situation in a country that was not preparing for war.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549244" height="960" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000002.jpeg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000002.jpeg" width="1204"/><p>The hero of our story did not put his hands and returned to public service. He got a job as a kinologist to train service dogs. Responsibility and love for animals quickly allowed him to gain authority and respect, but from the proposed training for the role of "boar" - an experienced instructor who trains dogs to attack himself - the man refused. Military service was more important to him.</p><h2>Become a military nearly prevented the knee injury</h2><p>In 2019, Ruslan tried to join the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine again - and again encountered an obstacle. This time he failed to undergo a medical commission.</p><p>The reason for the refusal of doctors was the knee injury - Ruslan suffered it during the reconstruction of historical fencing for the famous Old Fortress festival.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549245" height="960" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000003.jpeg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000003.jpeg" width="720"/><p>The refusal was extremely upset by Ruslan, because he deliberately sought and prepared for service in the army for a long time. This was noticed by the officers who offered him a test two-week period, which the man withdrew with dignity, and then joined the ranks of the Airborne troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p><h2>Bumblby's call sign gave historical fencing</h2><p>The original call sign Ruslan was presented with the same historical fencing, trauma during which he almost prevented him from becoming a military.</p><p>During the training, friends, evaluating the good character and sociable attitude of Ruslan, began to call him "Bamblebi" in honor of the famous popular film hero from the films of the franchise "Transformers".</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549246" height="1600" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000004.jpeg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000004.jpeg" width="1600"/><p>According to the plot of the films, it was the best to get along with people, first of all with children, was a true friend and a fearless fighter. Such a nickname perfectly suited Ruslan, who gladly kept him as a call sign in military service.</p><h2>Help the Wife helped</h2><p>Before a large-scale invasion, Ruslan served in a separate airmobile brigade of the landing troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, participated in the operation of the Joint Forces in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>At the beginning of a large -scale invasion, he had to defend his family, where his family, friends and acquaintances were. The war was not something new and unfamiliar to Ruslan, but the horror of the first days struck even such an experienced warrior as Bamblebi.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549247" height="718" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000005.jpeg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000005.jpeg" width="960"/><p>- I was very worried about my wife and my daughter, constantly thinking about how to save them. I thank Svetlana, who firmly said that the best way to protect them is to fight the enemy with his brothers.</p><h2>Conversation with her husband gave Svetlana a ray of hope</h2><p>Ruslana Svetlana's wife, who stands nearby, also mentions the first days of large -scale aggression:</p><p>- It was a day -to -day day. Covered despair. It was here that the man called and said that his unit in Sumy: "We are here, in Sumy!". And then I called my mom, called her girlfriends and reported: “Ours here. The Armed Forces did not throw us, our military will protect us! ”. It was like a ray of hope that it is probably something good.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549248" height="768" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000006.jpeg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000006.jpeg" width="777"/><p>Later, Svetlana supported the residents of Sumy, assuring that the military they saw on the streets was a Ukrainian army that came to defend the city. "She assured people in line that everything would be fine, our boys will protect us," she recalls.</p><h2>Latte, cappuccino and "our eyes"</h2><p>The first days were remembered by the couple with a sense of extraordinary cohesion and mutual support between civilians and military. Ruslan gratefully remembers the Sumy Terroboron fighters who fought side by side with paratroopers, and civilians who helped everyone they could.</p><p>- One uncle brought us oil for armored vehicles, mechanics were delighted because they needed it very much. Other time, a guy on a car from whom they trade coffee on the street came to us, and he treated everyone for free to all who only who wanted - Latte, Capuchino.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549249" height="640" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000007.jpeg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000007.jpeg" width="960"/><p>Particularly valuable, remembers Bamblebi, became the help of a young man who traveled by the car and regularly called the military, reporting the situation.</p><p>- I called him "our eyes" and always immediately took the phone as soon as he called, - the paratrooper recalls.</p><h2>Drawing a girl from a swan</h2><p>After the first fighting, the paratroopers went to Lebedin, where Ruslan was lucky enough to get a guard who rescued him twice from his death during the war. It was a picture of a local girl named Pauline with a simple sincere inscription: "Thank you for protecting us!".</p><p>The drawing with the food was brought by the military mom of Polina Natalia, and Ruslan left him, hiding closer to his heart under the bulletproof vest. Since then, the military has not parted with his charm until he saved his life in Zaporozhye.</p><div class="fotorama--wp" data-auto="false" data-captiontag="dd" data-columns="0" data-icontag="dt" data-ids="549250,549251,549252" data-itemtag="dl" data-link="file" data-max-width="100%" data-ratio="1.5" data-size="large" data-width="1500"><div class="gallery galleryid-549241 gallery-columns-0 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-1"><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000008.jpg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000008.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon portrait"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000009.jpeg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000009.jpeg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon portrait"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000010.jpeg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T12-10-99/000010.jpeg" width="150"/></dt></dl></div></div><p>- I was injured in Zaporizhzhya, and when I was removed from my bulletproof vest, they accidentally lost the picture.

The height of a large -scale invasion. The Russian military only dream of Odessa and caress the city. 12:00. From the clouds, two enemy Su-34 are flew to the second circle-and here an instant shot from Igla's MSrk. The sound of explosion and expectation ...</strong></p><p>In an exclusive interview for the correspondent, the ArmyInform, sailor Dmitry, plunged into memories of the first time for the whole time of the Russian-Ukrainian war, the killing of the Su-34 enemy from the ship, the maritime battle with Admiral Makarov frigate and the reflection of Shahaneda attack.</p><p>- I remember this day quite well. The fuss prevailed everywhere, but my brothers tried to support each other and joke. The sky was quite cloudy at the time, and the hum was not even heard from the enemy Su-34. In an instant, from under the clouds, a pair of "drying" of the enemy was sprinkled at a distance of 1.5 km from our ship. They started working in the city ... - Dmitry recalls.</p><p>The sailor immediately grabbed the Igla MSr. His ship rushed towards the Su-34, which had to go to the second circle. Dmitry expected. As soon as the aircraft of the racists were poured out of the clouds and wanted to turn back, Dmitry made a start. Explosion, crashing and expectations.</p><p>-I went immediately, took the second projectile and hoped that the second Su-34 would return, but he fled. It was about 30 minutes and we were confirmed that the hostile plane was shot down. The first thing I said after this news: "Welcome to hell!" We were all unrealistic happy.</p><p>Dmitry recalls that the first two months from the beginning of a large -scale invasion were the most difficult, because they did not see sushi at all. There were also no connection with the sailors, except for short and so rare moments to say to my family for a moment: "I am alive." The unknown from what is happening in the native country, which is covered by a bloody war, just drove crazy ...</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549471" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000001.jpg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000001.jpg" width="1500"/><p>-My dad was my birthday a few days after I knocked down the Su-34. Then we managed to talk on the phone. He immediately began to ask me to protect myself, and I just answered him that he had knocked down a hostile plane. Then the father expressed his emotions very vividly ...</p><p>Shortly after the landing pilot of the enemy, the crew of Dmitry took the maritime battle in the Black Sea against the Admiral Makarov frigate.</p><p>- We have already completed our task and turned back, as we felt that someone was shooting us in the back. Then we were told that it was a frigate. We decided to bring it as close to land as possible, and our artillerymen worked there. It was so enchanting that Admiral Makarov escaped in full couples up to Sevastopol, - Dmitry said.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549473" height="945" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000002.jpeg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000002.jpeg" width="1500"/><p>On land, sailors are extremely rare. There is enough work, because the enemy is constantly trying to fire Odessa "Shahmed" and rockets.</p><p>- When the enemy fired at the sea station, we reflected that attack. Shahamed landed 50 meters from our ship. The next flew right in us, and we knocked him down from the machine gun, getting into the wing. He fell 10 meters away from us, and all then washed with water. Next we had a planned movement. As soon as we departed, all the hostile shit flew directly to our point. Lucky…</p><p>The anti -aircraft says that he had been dreaming of the sea since childhood. His grandfather and great -grandfather were also sailors.</p><p>-There is little positive in the war, but when we go to the port and see in the morning, as the sun only wakes up from the horizon, and the sea calm soothes with its majestic and crystal transparency, you realize that it is the most amazing thing you see. No matter how hard it happens, everything will be in the past, and the future we will all be good.</p><div class="fotorama--wp" data-auto="false" data-captiontag="dd" data-columns="0" data-icontag="dt" data-ids="549470,549469" data-itemtag="dl" data-link="file" data-max-width="100%" data-ratio="1.628664495114" data-size="large" data-width="1500"><div class="gallery galleryid-549463 gallery-columns-0 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-1"><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000003.jpeg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000003.jpeg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000004.jpeg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000004.jpeg" width="150"/></dt></dl></div></div><p>Dmitry says that he wants to knock down a few more Su-34, Su-57 and IL-76.
