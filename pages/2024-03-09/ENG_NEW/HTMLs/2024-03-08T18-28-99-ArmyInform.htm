The height of a large -scale invasion. The Russian military only dream of Odessa and caress the city. 12:00. From the clouds, two enemy Su-34 are flew to the second circle-and here an instant shot from Igla's MSrk. The sound of explosion and expectation ...</strong></p><p>In an exclusive interview for the correspondent, the ArmyInform, sailor Dmitry, plunged into memories of the first time for the whole time of the Russian-Ukrainian war, the killing of the Su-34 enemy from the ship, the maritime battle with Admiral Makarov frigate and the reflection of Shahaneda attack.</p><p>- I remember this day quite well. The fuss prevailed everywhere, but my brothers tried to support each other and joke. The sky was quite cloudy at the time, and the hum was not even heard from the enemy Su-34. In an instant, from under the clouds, a pair of "drying" of the enemy was sprinkled at a distance of 1.5 km from our ship. They started working in the city ... - Dmitry recalls.</p><p>The sailor immediately grabbed the Igla MSr. His ship rushed towards the Su-34, which had to go to the second circle. Dmitry expected. As soon as the aircraft of the racists were poured out of the clouds and wanted to turn back, Dmitry made a start. Explosion, crashing and expectations.</p><p>-I went immediately, took the second projectile and hoped that the second Su-34 would return, but he fled. It was about 30 minutes and we were confirmed that the hostile plane was shot down. The first thing I said after this news: "Welcome to hell!" We were all unrealistic happy.</p><p>Dmitry recalls that the first two months from the beginning of a large -scale invasion were the most difficult, because they did not see sushi at all. There were also no connection with the sailors, except for short and so rare moments to say to my family for a moment: "I am alive." The unknown from what is happening in the native country, which is covered by a bloody war, just drove crazy ...</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549471" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000001.jpg" width="1500"/><p>-My dad was my birthday a few days after I knocked down the Su-34. Then we managed to talk on the phone. He immediately began to ask me to protect myself, and I just answered him that he had knocked down a hostile plane. Then the father expressed his emotions very vividly ...</p><p>Shortly after the landing pilot of the enemy, the crew of Dmitry took the maritime battle in the Black Sea against the Admiral Makarov frigate.</p><p>- We have already completed our task and turned back, as we felt that someone was shooting us in the back. Then we were told that it was a frigate. We decided to bring it as close to land as possible, and our artillerymen worked there. It was so enchanting that Admiral Makarov escaped in full couples up to Sevastopol, - Dmitry said.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549473" height="945" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000002.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000002.jpeg" width="1500"/><p>On land, sailors are extremely rare. There is enough work, because the enemy is constantly trying to fire Odessa "Shahmed" and rockets.</p><p>- When the enemy fired at the sea station, we reflected that attack. Shahamed landed 50 meters from our ship. The next flew right in us, and we knocked him down from the machine gun, getting into the wing. He fell 10 meters away from us, and all then washed with water. Next we had a planned movement. As soon as we departed, all the hostile shit flew directly to our point. Lucky…</p><p>The anti -aircraft says that he had been dreaming of the sea since childhood. His grandfather and great -grandfather were also sailors.</p><p>-There is little positive in the war, but when we go to the port and see in the morning, as the sun only wakes up from the horizon, and the sea calm soothes with its majestic and crystal transparency, you realize that it is the most amazing thing you see. No matter how hard it happens, everything will be in the past, and the future we will all be good.</p><div class="fotorama--wp" data-auto="false" data-captiontag="dd" data-columns="0" data-icontag="dt" data-ids="549470,549469" data-itemtag="dl" data-link="file" data-max-width="100%" data-ratio="1.628664495114" data-size="large" data-width="1500"><div class="gallery galleryid-549463 gallery-columns-0 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-1"><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000003.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000003.jpeg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000004.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T18-28-99/000004.jpeg" width="150"/></dt></dl></div></div><p>Dmitry says that he wants to knock down a few more Su-34, Su-57 and IL-76. The main thing is that in the latter he was one who brought so much grief to our native Ukraine.</p></div>
