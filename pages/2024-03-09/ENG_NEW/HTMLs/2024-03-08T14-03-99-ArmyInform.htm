Because there are those units that are part of the Black Sea Fleet of the so -called Russian Federation, as they could not return to base points through Turkish ducts, as they are known all over the world, we are often called Bosphorus and Dardanelles ... who could not return Even in the Black Sea, through the validity of the Montrere Convention for 36 years, which allows the Turkish Republic to make such a decision to prohibit the passage of this strait of ships, combat units of warring countries, ”the Navy spokesman said.</p><p>At the same time, he believes that it will not be possible to strike Russian ships from the Mediterranean.</p><p>“Of course, it is virtually impossible to apply a fire damage to the territory of Ukraine for the enemy from that water area. There was no such practice. Because rockets have to cross the space of NATO countries. And this, according to international law, is a precedent that can be interpreted as an attack. Therefore, there were no such cases, ”Dmitry Pletenchuk said.</p><p>As reported by the Armyinform, on March 7, 2024 Dmitry Pletenchuk<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/07/u-vms-zsu-sprognozuvaly-novu-czil-dlya-znyshhennya-u-rosijskomu-floti/">predicted</a>That very soon in the Black Sea will appear another candidate in the list of "Don Navy" of the Russian Federation.</p></div>
