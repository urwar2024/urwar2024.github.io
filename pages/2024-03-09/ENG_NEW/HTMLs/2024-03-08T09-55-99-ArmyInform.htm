Like, I will not go to the stream - either sign a contract, or now break a personal business - and look for the wind in the field.</strong></p><p>The guy was then taken to the contract service - the KAMAZ driver. Within a few years, a relevant fighter went to the gun commander, and later became a cat.</p><p>Now his calculation is destroyed by the enemy in the Donetsk direction on the D-20 gun, before that they worked for M777.</p><p>- On February 23, 2022, they went to meet the enemy from the Crimea. I saw the first rockets nearby. Drying over their heads flew. It was a little so difficult to go inside, but the work was distracted, - the "light" recalls.</p><p>In 2022, he and his brothers destroyed the columns of enemy equipment, which dried on Nikolaev.</p><div class="fotorama--wp" data-auto="false" data-captiontag="dd" data-columns="0" data-icontag="dt" data-ids="549172,549173" data-itemtag="dl" data-link="file" data-max-width="100%" data-ratio="1.5" data-size="large" data-width="1500"><div class="gallery galleryid-549170 gallery-columns-0 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-1"><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T09-55-99/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T09-55-99/000001.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T09-55-99/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T09-55-99/000002.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl></div></div><p>- The guns were tried and serviced, hit the enemy technique that was actively moving. What about the bright remember? But everything was burning brightly. The D-30 Division. The enemy gas truck was covered with the first shot where the dancers were refueled. And after him, the dancers, - smiles the military.</p><p>Sometimes, from one position, the shelters of guns were spread in different directions and worked constantly, stopping the enemy BTGRIs who tried to surround our infantrymen.</p><div class="fotorama--wp" data-auto="false" data-captiontag="dd" data-columns="0" data-icontag="dt" data-ids="549174,549175,549176" data-itemtag="dl" data-link="file" data-max-width="100%" data-ratio="1.5" data-size="large" data-width="1500"><div class="gallery galleryid-549170 gallery-columns-0 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-3"><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T09-55-99/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T09-55-99/000003.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T09-55-99/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T09-55-99/000004.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T09-55-99/000005.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T09-55-99/000005.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl></div></div><p>The greatest return and pleasure from the work "Flash" felt when his commander was called from other units and thanked. Literally, for the sweat of some soldiers who preserved the blood of others.</p><p>… We communicate with the "fire" in the armor, because to go out once again - to draw attention to the fire point.</p><p>All in turn a small kitten is swollen. The fighters say that they have picked it up in positions, since then they bring with them.</p><p>- The name is fool, because we are injured, but we have no problems with mice, - says Rostislav's gunner.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549177" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T09-55-99/000006.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T09-55-99/000006.jpg" width="1500"/><p>Flash is constantly checking the phone because the target can fly.</p><p>- We have 2 minutes from getting the target to the opening of the fire, I count on the go, we run out of the armor, we work immediately back to the shelter. According to the classic - if you need to work out as quickly as possible, work from the handle, the lace makes it possible to protect yourself during work. First, the "spray" can be, secondly, a gap in the barrel.</p><p>We work from a lace, from shelter, because people need to be kept. You change the car and one life is one. And the girlfriend is good to teach a long time, which is given in 30 seconds from scratch. A good specialist for the weight of gold, - says "Light".</p><p>And the gunner Rostislav modestly says that he did not think about a military career, worked as a builder. But he could not stand aside during the war.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549178" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T09-55-99/000007.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-08T09-55-99/000007.jpg" width="1500"/><p>- At first I was charged. Then the commander said, "Why not try." I look - it turns out. And there the speed worked. He studied just at the battle, - says the guy.</p><p>… Actually, we witness the combat work, everything happens so quickly that I barely have time to filter the shot.</p><p>In the sky there are enemy "birds", and we must quickly leave the fire point.</p><p>Finally, the "Light" tells that artillerymen talk to weapons. And each gun has a name that traditionally gives it a comha. This D-20 is called "Marina".</p><p>Recently it was she who helped the infantry units to knock the enemy out of Krasnogorivka:</p><p>- We need to talk to her weapon, she listens. Although it is metal, it also feels. Believe it, there were times when you say to her, "Little, well, they should be charged" - and in fact clearly hit.</p><p><em>Photo by the author</em></p></div>
