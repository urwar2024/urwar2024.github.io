The distance is about 800 meters. One short worked.

Everything should be greased and no dirt. This weapon is our older sister. When you go to a position, you become one with it. You have to say with her: \"Oh, well -groomed, you have worked well today, you need to relax\" or \"Well, what are you starting? Need to rest? Well, let's rest. \" I do not know how, but it helps, - says \"virus\".</p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-549224\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-08T12-02-99/000006.jpg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-08T12-02-99/000006.jpg\" width=\"1500\"><p>The military emphasizes that it is most effective to work with DSKS, two or three cartridges.

There is no difficulty for me. We train, squat, run. The \"breathable\" should be developed, because to go far, you need to carry a lot of BC, weapons. My brother and I carried a \"board\" to a position, these are two kilometers of distance. Plus 50 to itself with BC and plus \"board\" from above.
