Because faster they do not have time to draw results. \" This time, the Holuis of the regime tried to \"excellent\", entertaining the old dictator \"overwhelming\" percent of support, which was not in all the recent history of Russia.</strong></p><p>It is also interesting that Putin won the elections not only in Russia but also in foreign areas - and the Russians went to the vote even more actively than the average in the country, which was frankly surprised and pleased with the propagandists. Their resources were full of photographs and videos of queues to embassies in Italy, Thailand, Germany, Czech Republic ...</p><p>Contributed to a record turnout, in particular, the so -called \"Russian opposition\", which held an action \"noon against Putin\". Its meaning was that Russian citizens who did not support the policy of the Kremlin head visited the polling stations on the last day of the presidential election at 12 o'clock in the day, showing the \"unity of place and time of protest\", regardless of how they do with their ballots .</p><p>Back in the nineteenth century, Russian writer Mikhail Saltikov-Shredrin,<a href=\"https://w.wiki/9W4G\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">telling</a>About the history of the generalized Russian city of fools (in Russian - Glupov), described the similar picture: \u201cAnd the fools were on their knees and waited.

If the turnout in the election was less than 50%, they could be questioned, as not reflecting the will of most Russians. And quite under the power of the Russian opposition, if it really existed, it would be to organize a general ignoring of pseudo -elections that have no choice. And at least speak in support of the RDC, LSR, Siberian battalion and other units, which began on March 12 on the position of the Putin Army in Kurshchyna and Belgorod. But volunteer units that are fighting for Russia without Putin have not yet waited for the words of support from Yulia Navalny, whose husband recently killed the regime. And the so -called anti -war candidate, a \"good Russian\" Davankov at a meeting with Putin after the election generally stated that they had a common goal - to \"win their\" ...</p><p>The Ukrainian military is right, who say that only the one who is not visible in a thermal imager is a \"good Russian\".</p><p>Putin's Card Blanche is now. Not only thanks to the percentage of their beloved (87.28%), which the Russians have long learned to \"swallow\". But also thanks to the record in the history of the presidential election in the Russian Federation - 77.4%. Now there is no doubt that the Kremlin owner will use this result to maximize the war in Ukraine without sparing neither the financial or human resource. And perhaps it will continue - to the adjacent countries of the European Union, because it is the blood of a \"hateful event\" that is awaiting a bloody \"electorate\", which continued the dictatorial powers until 2030 ...</p><p>The \"astronomical\" percentage of the drawn turnout and support of the Kremlin dictator on pseudo -elections has nothing strange or new.</p><figure class=\"kg-card ai-readalso-card\"><a class=\"ai-readalso-container\" href=\"https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/06/zhyvi-i-mertvi-dyktatory-rejtyng-zla-za-versiyeyu-armiyainform/\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"ai-readalso-content\"><div class=\"ai-readalso-title\">Living and Dead Dictators: Rating of Evil According to ArmyInform</div></div><div class=\"ai-readalso-thumbnail\"><img alt=\"\u0416\u0438\u0432\u0456 \u0456 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0456 \u0434\u0438\u043a\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438: \u0440\u0435\u0439\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u0437\u043b\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0456\u0454\u044e \u0410\u0440\u043c\u0456\u044fInform\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-19T16-33-00-08-00/000001.png\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-19T16-33-00-08-00/000001.png\"/></div></a></figure><p>In 1964, the crazy dictator of Haiti Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier, the sadly known ruthless destruction of the population of his country, held a referendum on his lifelong rule.
