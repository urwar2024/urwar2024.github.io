Each participant has received extensive experience and confidence. No one expected that we would choose so many medals. I want to thank all the team members who made the team from us. Sport is an example for those who have been injured and do not understand how to be further. I also express their gratitude to the Ministry of Veterans and all organizers who have provided us with the opportunity to represent Ukraine in the international sports arena. We were also a way to remind us of the world of Ukraine and bring our victory closer, \u201dYuriy Gaponchuk stressed.</p><div class=\"\"><div>Recall that the competitions of the United States Air Force Trials 2024 participated 30 Ukrainian veterans and servicemen with wounds at the invitation of the US Air Force.
