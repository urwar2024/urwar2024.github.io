Since then, about £ 100 million has been allocated to the program.</p><p>Currently, the British army can repel drones, only releasing expensive missiles, each of which can cost up to $ 2 million. Meanwhile, the cost of exploitation of a new laser is "less than $ 13 per shot", DSTL said. Its maximum range is classified, but weapons can "impress any visible goal", the laboratory statement said.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-552829" height="691" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T09-11-00-08-00/000002.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T09-11-00-08-00/000002.jpeg" width="1225"/><p>"This type of advanced weapons can make a revolution in combat space by reducing the dependence on expensive ammunition, as well as reducing the risk of concomitant losses," said Grant Shapps Grant.</p><p>Anti -ratio lasers are a defensive weapon designed to fail or even destroy drones and permutative missiles with greater accuracy and less destruction than the missiles used today.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-552830" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_552830" style="width: 1227px"><img alt="" class="wp-image-552830 size-full" height="682" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T09-11-00-08-00/000003.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T09-11-00-08-00/000003.jpeg" width="1227"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-552830">Installation of Ldew British Laser Weapons Dragonfire and targets that were affected by it.

At the same time, drones also have a much lower action range than conventional UAV missiles, and they are not capable of providing sufficient speed to knock down hypersonic objects that move five times faster than sound.</p><p>In addition, laser weapons require sensitive settings. If the beam is too intense, the interaction with the air can cause it to scatter. And if the beam is too weak, the target will remain unharmed. In addition, water droplets in the air or fog can absorb or scatter the beam, which impairs its effectiveness in adverse weather conditions.</p><p>However, the UK government has stated that it would continue to invest in laser protection technology and promote plans for their commissioning.</p><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCK9ghnv-VA?feature=oembed" title="Test footage of UK DragonFire Laser Directed Energy Weapon" width="640"></iframe></p><p>Dragonfire laser laser weapons tests.
