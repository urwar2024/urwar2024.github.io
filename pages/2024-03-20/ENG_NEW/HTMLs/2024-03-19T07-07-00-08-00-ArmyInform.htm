With her, he falls asleep and wakes up, making every effort to work to approach a common Ukrainian victory.</p><p>- There is no pathos in this opinion, the service is very daily, routine. It is not only heroism, but above all the fulfillment of your duty with the most achievable care and ability to use their knowledge and skills as fully as possible, - explains Taras Kompanichenko.</p><p>The military is happy that he, as he says, is "used as intended." The artist has now been involved in the team of the brigade service, where he performs both direct and related responsibilities related to national patriotic training.</p><h2>Recruiter preparation is a thorough and comprehensive</h2><p>- I read lectures in training centers where we prepare recruits for oath. As a teacher, I see well that nowadays training of recruits is not just a short formal course, but a serious comprehensive mastering of all basic necessary military knowledge. It is fire preparation, topography, cartography, communication, Takmed, legal issues ...</p><p>After intensive training, recruits become full -fledged military, who, like Taras Kompanichenko himself, are primarily involved in the tasks for which they have the best abilities and preparation, taking into account previous civil education and experience.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-552852" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T07-07-00-08-00/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T07-07-00-08-00/000001.jpg" width="1500"/><p>-My contribution to their preparation-lectures on national-patriotic training, history and culture of Ukraine. These are extremely important and extensive topics, such as the history of the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917-1921 and a further liberation struggle for independent free Ukraine. Or earlier examples of the fight against the Muscovites - the battle of 1173 near Vyshgorod, in 1514 near Orsha, in 1657 under Konotop, - says Taras.</p><h2>The best motivation is the opportunity to touch the past on your own</h2><p>Taras Kompanichenko brings live evidence of Ukrainian history from his own collection - manuscripts, rare publications, musical instruments. They are convinced of the listeners in the deeply smoky roots of the Ukrainian people.</p><p>- These are the manuscripts and publications of the Ukrainian national revival of the late XIX - early XX century. For example, published in 1906 by the fourth volume of "History of Ukraine-Rus" by Mikhail Hrushevsky, "Kayala" by Bohdan Lepky with the illustrations of Elena Kulchytska or Bogdan Khmelnytsky Mikhail Starytsky,-the artist lists.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-552853" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T07-07-00-08-00/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T07-07-00-08-00/000002.jpg" width="1500"/><p>He remembers with special warmth, the bandura of the Cossack Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic of Kosty Misevich. This musical instrument, which is still in use, can not only see or touch it, but also play it.</p><p>- When I bring these artifacts to lectures, fighters can touch them, open, look at the simple convincing testimony that we, Ukrainians, were in the past that our predecessors were already sought to be and were a full Ukrainian nation with developed science, with high high culture, - says Taras Kompanichenko.</p><h2>Inspires and obliges the strength of the spirit of boys and girls on the front line</h2><p>- Since the Russians have been driven away from Kiev, I have not been on the front line, nearly several times, - Taras notes. - They were different advanced - in Sumy region, near Kupyansk ... But I am always inspired by the power of the spirit that our boys and girls are filled there.</p><p>He says that he constantly follows several of his friends and acquaintances - those artists who are now fighting against Russian invaders at "zero". Among them are Yarina Chornohuz, Alexei Bick, Sergey Pantyuk and others.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-552854" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T07-07-00-08-00/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T07-07-00-08-00/000003.jpg" width="1500"/><p>Their strength of spirit and fearlessness inspire and at the same time oblige to be similar to them in the rear, to do everything possible to approach the victory.</p><p>- It is thanks to such people that we are able to do what we know the best. We can focus on bringing the greatest benefit to the Ukrainian people, - says the musician.</p><h2>Not to waste a minute remembering the feat of defenders</h2><p>Taras Kompanichenko is convinced that the heroism of great contemporaries places all of us. The immensely high price, which is paid every day by the fighters on the front line, they allow us to work for Ukraine.</p><p>- We cannot waste time in vain when someone is standing on the front line at this time. You have to be as hard as possible, to be as responsible as possible until it is not to deliver it on some empty, insignificant things, - the artist is convinced.</p><p>That is why every act, every action should now be performed with the greatest dedication, because they are possible precisely because they give them the defenders of Ukraine on the forefront for our opportunity to give them the most valuable thing they have - their own life.</p><h2>To overcome the fear for the sake of love, for "none of us are not there" of our ways. "</h2><p>At the same time, using the great gift that gave us the front lines, it should be remembered that we should replace them when they will be exhausted, or intercede if they fall.</p><p>- We all need to learn and prepare, - emphasizes Taras Kompanichenko, - because no one of us is from here - we can not and have no right to escape, hide, move or wait.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-552855" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T07-07-00-08-00/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T07-07-00-08-00/000004.jpg" width="1500"/><p>He is firmly convinced that we are all responsible for the future of Ukraine and the opportunity to live on our own land by Ukrainians.</p><p>- We must be and fight here, not wander and flee into lights, looking for some new Ukraine somewhere there, because then there will be some region of the Russian Federation, where there is no right to be Ukrainian. Therefore, we all have to get in one bench together and overcome fear for the sake of love for the most precious and holy we have.</p><h2>The right choice is to take a step towards</h2><p>Everyone who is still hesitant, whether it is necessary to join the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, Taras Kompanichenko advises to take a step towards, just as he and his sons committed.</p><p>The eldest son of a musician who is 25 years old is already serving. Young 23 years old and he has already announced the army and passes the VLK in Fastov. For them, both of them were a conscious voluntary choice, although they were not mobilized by age.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-552856" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T07-07-00-08-00/000005.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T07-07-00-08-00/000005.jpg" width="1500"/><p>- It was the choice to overcome your fear without waiting for you to be called to the army, - says Taras Kompanichenko. - They still had to wait, but they took a step towards. This is exactly what everyone who is hesitant, because "none of us," he repeats his ways, "he repeats.</p><h2>Win and survive for the sake of Ukraine</h2><p>The musician shares his natural fears for their sons, for their lives. However, he was convinced, they made the only right choice that they had to be used to bend their moral compass.</p><p>Taras Kompanichenko is convinced that the main task of the defenders of Ukraine is to destroy as many occupiers as possible and drive them away, but it is necessary to survive the most to prolong the life of the Ukrainian people on Ukrainian land.</p><figure class="kg-card ai-readalso-card"><a class="ai-readalso-container" href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/08/16/syaye-nebo-gra-zemlya-jdemo-v-bij-na-moskalya-gist-armiyainform-kobzar-taras-kompanichenko/" target="_blank"><div class="ai-readalso-content"><div class="ai-readalso-title">"The sky shines, the earth's game, we go to the battle of Muscovite!": Guest Armyinform Kobzar Taras Kompanichenko</div></div><div class="ai-readalso-thumbnail"><img alt="«Сяє небо, гра земля, йдемо в бій на москаля!»: гість АрміяInform кобзар Тарас Компаніченко" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T07-07-00-08-00/000006.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-19T07-07-00-08-00/000006.jpg"/></div></a></figure><p>- We need to build our strategy and tactics so that the occupiers will be killed as possible, and we will have more survived as possible, because we will need to make our kind of survive .</p></div>
