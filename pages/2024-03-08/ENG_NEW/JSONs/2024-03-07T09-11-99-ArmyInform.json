The satellite is equipped with a PTS-P (Protected Tactical Prototype) load-a system that is responsible for protecting the apparatus from enemy attempts to disable it.</p><p>Boeing said it plans to deliver the satellite to the customer in 2024. It is planned to be launched by the UNITED LAUNCH Alliance (ULA) Vulcan Centaur.</p><p>Wideband Global Satcom (WGS) Satellite Satellite Satellites include telecommunications satellites in geostationary orbit and is used to communicate in a programmed frequency spectrum. Due to its military purpose, their exact orbital positions are not disclosed.</p><p>The WGS satellite is made on the base of the Boeing 702 platform with a capacity of 13 kW, has a diagram of the antenna orientation of the antenna, which is reconfigured from the ground. The satellite is equipped with transponders of X- and KA bands and onboard router, which allows the satellite to connect two any arbitrary users within the service area.</p><p>The WGS-11+ version is twice as productive than its predecessors. In this case, one WGS apparatus is endowed with such bandwidth as the entire DSCS constellation. The system supports communication and data transmission for tactical and operational management of military operations, as well as for intelligence and combat missions.</p><p>Boeing builds military satellites in El Sedundo, California. According to the contract, the WGS-12 must be delivered in January 2029.</p><p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vcMIMRV23Qg?list=PLisXk-Y3grXrjdgLjvGzYt3JV2eZ0K9CJ\" title=\"Wideband Global SATCOM overview\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p><p>The principle of WGS satellite grouping.
