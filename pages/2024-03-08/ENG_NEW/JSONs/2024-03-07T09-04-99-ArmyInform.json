As you can see, the enemy does not go into our Black Sea for the third day. For clear reasons, \u201dDmitry Pletenchuk said.</p><p>\u201cAlways after the incidents, as it happened to the next patrol ship of the Black Sea Fleet, they analyze the situation, understand it. Now, most likely, someone answers very uncomfortable questions from the Command of the Black Sea Fleet. So now the relative lull in the Black Sea waters, \u201dhe added.</p><p>The Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stated that usually the enemy has such an analysis for several days.</p><p>\u201cIt is usually a few days. When they analyze the situation, they will understand once again that they do not have a special choice, that they are still forced to complete the task. Because, in addition to the territorial waters they occupy, they have their own shore in the Black Sea, their territorial waters. And these tasks are as forced to perform as in the Azov Sea. And so, I think, in a short period of time, we will see the next candidate to replenish the list of the Don Fleet of the Russian Federation somewhere off the coast of Crimea, maybe in the Kerch Strait, \u201dDmitry Pletenchuk said.</p><p>As<a href=\"https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/05/u-chornomu-mori-ukrayinski-morski-drony-znyshhyly-rosijskyj-korabel/\">reported</a>The Armyinform, on the night of March 4 to March 5, 2024, the GRU of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Group 13 attacked the patrol ship of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation.
