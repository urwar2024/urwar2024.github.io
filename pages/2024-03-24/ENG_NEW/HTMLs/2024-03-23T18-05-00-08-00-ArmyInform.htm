The man was fond of the willpower of the brother: the wounded with almost a detached limb did not give a single moan.</strong></p><p>In the meantime, he was assisted, burning, joking and smiling. Therefore, the correspondent of the Armyinform did not lose the chance to get acquainted with the former Terrobron ...</p><p>Before the "great" war, Max worked as a builder - he had a brigade, a few months before the great Russian invasion, a son was born in the couple.</p><p>Already in the first days of the Russian invasion, the man began to look for the opportunity to join the ranks of the Ukrainian army, but due to lack of combat experience he was denied everywhere.</p><p>In March 2022, he saw an announcement that a new team of terroboron was being formed. And the next day he wore the Ukrainian unicorn - first occupied the position, the driver, then the shooter. Subsequently, Maxim also mastered a sniper case ...</p><p>It is shared that military affairs had to study an impromptu: day and night, on the street and on the basements between the duty in the posts - the northern neighbor, who had fallen with the war in Ukraine, did not expect, trying to seize and destroy as many territories of our country as possible.</p><p>Already in the spring of the Terrobronivtsi, they were owned by a separate assault brigade named after the Koshovo Ataman Ivan Sirko, participated in the liberation of the village of Kutuzivka and the border settlement of Ternov, in Kharkiv region.</p><p>Baptism for Max and many of his brothers took place there in Thornova. On May 11, 2022, Ukrainian units occupied one of the streets, the rest of the village was under the control of ork.</p><img alt="" class="vimg alignnone wp-image-554934 size-full" height="1280" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T18-05-00-08-00/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T18-05-00-08-00/000001.jpg" width="960"/><p>Maxim recalls that the Russians resorted to various tricks to do as much harm to the Ukrainian units: they tried to lure volunteers, many of whom did not have military experience, traps and shot, tried to penetrate into positions, dressing Ukrainian pixel.</p><p>- There were about 80 people, we were about 250 ... But they were professional military, and we were "Shalopai", which just a couple of months, as they took their arms. It was scary, it was painful, but it was definitely not ashamed, because we finally became entrenched and "squeezed" from there the enemy-despite the crazy work of their aircraft, tanks and art,-the man recalls.</p><img alt="" class="vimg alignnone wp-image-554935 size-full" height="1600" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T18-05-00-08-00/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T18-05-00-08-00/000002.jpg" width="1200"/><p>After the liberation of Kharkiv region, a battalion under the leadership of the Combat on the pseudo "Spaniard", where Maxim served, received the team to move to the Donetsk region. The task was to knock out the occupiers near the settlement of Ivanovske, who, using low temperature, crossed the reservoir and wedged into the defense of our troops.</p><p>The beginning of February 2023 was cold - in some places frost came down to a minus twenty, so it was difficult to dig properly: trenches that were located in the open terrain were not deeper than 1 m, and the distance to the enemy - about 120 meters.</p><img alt="" class="vimg alignnone wp-image-554936 size-full" height="1280" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T18-05-00-08-00/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T18-05-00-08-00/000003.jpg" width="960"/><p>In order for the military to be able to build at least a clear shelter, the Spaniard ordered the construction of building materials at night. The dump truck broke into positions, dropped the cargo and quickly rode back.</p><p>- In front of us stood "Wagnerivtsi". They tried to storm several times a day. But later the situation changed - after two weeks the boys "taught" them very quickly under fire, a month later they were almost seen with the naked eye. Only around the frozen bodies of those who had the carelessness of participating in their "meat storms", - recalls Terrobronovets.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-554937 size-full" height="1152" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T18-05-00-08-00/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T18-05-00-08-00/000004.jpg" width="1536"/><p>And Maxim had already served in the intelligence unit. He shares that he, along with his brothers, "jammed" the enemy in the rear. How alone - he prefers not to tell ...</p><p>In early April 2023, Kharkiv Terrobronivtsi occupied a defense near the railway along the elevator in Bakhmut. Maxim remembers that they came to the city they are difficult and with losses, as the enemy kept the entrances to him under fire control from three directions. In the fortress itself, the reconnaissance unit has brought their brothers directly into positions, choosing the safest ways.</p><p>- In addition to constant storms, we were constantly working on Russian art and aviation. As soon as we take a position in a house, in a couple of days it was carried out completely. But we also "trimmed" the orcs a huge number, - the man recalls.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-554938 size-full" height="1200" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T18-05-00-08-00/000005.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T18-05-00-08-00/000005.jpg" width="1600"/><p>But because of the advantage of living forces and weapons, the enemy continued the offensive, gradually occupying the quarter over the city quarter. The "outputs" of the intelligence of the Trobronians became less frequent. For the most part, Maxim has been performing the duties of the AGS operator.</p><p>- When they changed people in positions, I covered them from a grenade while they were loaded with a car. There was a case when the boys were in the basement, I worked on the enemy until they got them from the rubble.</p><p>On April 24, 2023, when Maxim was injured, he was on one of the positions. At about 12 o'clock, the enemy tank started operating. Each of his shots were getting closer, but there was no way to change their place of residence - the Russians at that time were recovering Ukrainian units.</p><p>The fourth enemy shell kissed the tree next to Maxim - it saved the life of the military: the trunk took over the main blow. But a few small rocks hit the AGS - his "drum" tore, damaging his hand, the face of the terroboronov, and pulling out the knee joint of the right leg.</p><p>- I was able to crawl to the shelter, the guys provided the necessary help. At the evacuation point, they pulled me on some door - an hour and a half, as the orcs wing us from what they could. My "stretcher" was so heavy that the brothers, barely reaching me to the "Stability", lost consciousness ...</p><p>Under frantic shelling, the ordinary pickup of a wounded terroboronov was sent to a hospital in Druzhkivka. In order to somehow fix the injured limb, they were fixed with a regular screwdriver. Without anesthesia ... without painkillers ...</p><p>And then there was a number of operations on the leg and from the transplantation of the skin. Now Maxim moves with a crutch, because the limb does not bend due to the absence of the knee.</p><img alt="" class="vimg alignnone wp-image-554939 size-full" height="1280" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T18-05-00-08-00/000006.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T18-05-00-08-00/000006.jpg" width="960"/><p>The military commission is recognized as unfit for military service ... But despite constant pain in the limb, he does not lose positive. He says there is whom to live and there is something to rejoice - a second child, a daughter's daughter, have been born in the family.</p><figure class="kg-card ai-readalso-card"><a class="ai-readalso-container" href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/11/komandyr-kazhe-shho-podaruvav-mene-nachmedu-istoriya-bojovogo-medyka-balu/" target="_blank"><div class="ai-readalso-content"><div class="ai-readalso-title">"The commander says he gave me to the chief" - the story</div></div><div class="ai-readalso-thumbnail"><img alt="«Командир каже, що подарував мене начмеду» — історія бойового медика «Балу»" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T18-05-00-08-00/000007.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T18-05-00-08-00/000007.jpg"/></div></a></figure><p><span style="color: #999999;">Photo from the archive of the hero and battalion of the TR</span></p></div>
