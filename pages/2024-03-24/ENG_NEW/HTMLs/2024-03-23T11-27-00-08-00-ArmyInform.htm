It looked like something like a mental attack on the side, but maybe it was an order to evacuate someone wounded or something, ”he said.</span></p><p><span>The officer added that such actions were very strange and clearly ineffective because it was the perfect goal, at night they were destroyed very quickly and this tactic stopped very quickly.</span></p><p><span>"Now they use this by the line from their firing positions to bring some cargo," - said Yaroslav Galas.</span></p><p><span>The officer also stressed that the Russians are actively working in the dark.</span></p><p><span>“All the storms that were before, using three, four or more pieces of equipment, began before dawn: to get closer to our positions with the first rays of the sun. Therefore, the use of their FPV-oules has increased lately. Now in our direction there are several Russian units that consider themselves "elite", and they have a basic emphasis-it is in the night FPV-theroms, "he added.</span></p><p><span>Yaroslav Galas noted that in this direction the Russians have a powerfully work with radio electronic struggle.</span></p><p><span>“If we have conditional parity on the drones, then the Russians have escaped, so to speak, forward and our UAV operators often have to move to another frequency, they modify their rebves accordingly. Such a position confrontation in the sky is ongoing, ”the officer of the press service of the 128th Separate Mountain Assault Transcarpathian brigade summarized.</span></p><p>Yaroslav Galas<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/23/na-zaporizkomu-napryamku-vorog-shukaye-slabki-misczya-v-oboroni-zroslo-vykorystannya-nichnyh-fpv-droniv/">told</a>that in the Zaporizhzhya direction the Russians actively involve the night FPV-pans, dismiss poisonous substances from the drones, and try to find weaknesses in the defense of Ukrainian positions.</p></div>
