Almost 100 people have been united by a common idea and a desire to save lives and have been working for our victory for the seventh consecutive year.</strong></p><p>SEO of Yaroslav Filimonov, exclusively for the correspondent, the ArmyInform spoke about the idea of the company, its specialization, the means of Reb and Rer and the benefits of a single Ukrainian manufacturer of such systems.</p><p><strong>- The company is on the market since 2017. In fact, you have found both a more local phase of war and large -scale. Please tell us how the idea came up to establish a company?</strong></p><p>- The idea was not easy. The founder of the company Andrew from the Luhansk region - it was quite painful for him from the outset, because he worried all this and saw with his own eyes. Subsequently, he united like -minded people, engineers - we all worked together for almost a year, studied products and various equipment.</p><p>Before the beginning of the Great War, when all people heard the word "Reb", they immediately imagined two Kamazs, which were transporting huge attitudes. So it was, but it was a long -range Reb. Our goal was to create our own Ukrainian remedies of electronic struggle of near action. So, in 2016, we created our first antitrone gun, and in 2017 our company was born.</p><p><strong>- Who is currently working in your team and what are its basic principles?</strong></p><p>- As for our employees, I always say that this is our main asset. All people in us are united by a common idea and really burn the desire to work. There are those who are engaged in more installation professions. We also have the rule that 20% of company employees are veterans.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-554722" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_554722" style="width: 1500px"><img alt="" class="wp-image-554722 size-full" height="1125" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T06-48-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T06-48-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" width="1500"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-554722">Photo: Olga Vikarchuk / Armyinform</figcaption></figure><p>We have defenders who have fought and since 2014 are those who have since 2022. These are people who have repeatedly said goodbye to their lives but survived, were injured and are already unsuitable for service in the army. We are all aware of the difficulties of PTSD and our duty to help veterans go back and help the country here. In addition, our team has the concept of "veteran for veteran". That is, we have a military psychologist who was also injured, he was hell and now helps his brothers to adapt.</p><p><strong>- How do you test the remedies?</strong></p><p>- We, as a company that works on a government order, is constantly experiencing huge responsibility for human lives. We have a quality control department that checks us quite well. When we are conventionally calling the chief of the ERS of one of the brigades and says: "We need 10 antitrone rifles," the first question I arises, what is the direction, what area there, what objects need to protect, what obstacles can be. Much depends on what area our means are needed in. When we are already collecting a "full history", then it may be that 10 antitrone rifles do not need, because to protect the point of artillery, our HR "Kraken" is needed, if there is still PCB, then they are other means of radio electronic wrestling.</p><p>Then we already approve the time and place with the representative of the brigade, we invite even adjacent units and go to the forefront, so that our own example to demonstrate the EW in work. Usually we work 10 kilometers from the very "zero", I put on our Reb Sruzak and we go, "plant" "Maviika" and FPV-troops.</p><p>I always say that you don't need better marketing than what I am still alive. Every day our boys call from positions and thank for our means. Most recently, there was a situation that I was called by defenders and said that they could not evacuate the wounded for a long time, because as soon as they were putting on the point, the enemy "birds" made raids.</p><p>We sent them our hits, one of the members of this small group came up with this. Absolutely all the "birds" of the enemy landed. When the enemy realizes that he cannot impress with his drones, they begin to use art and mortars. Our fighters returned alive, the remedy rescued the defender who went with him from the fragile wound of the defender.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-554723" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_554723" style="width: 1500px"><img alt="" class="wp-image-554723 size-full" height="1125" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T06-48-00-08-00/000002.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T06-48-00-08-00/000002.jpeg" width="1500"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-554723">Photo: Olga Vikarchuk / Armyinform</figcaption></figure><p><strong>- How often does your team go to the front?</strong></p><p>- Our team works at the front every week. Personally, I also try to travel to the fighting area at least twice a month. Our main task is to teach all the military who turn to us and to show how our remedies work.</p><p>When we find ourselves in the immediate vicinity of the front line, we start working. Three to four hours of active and fruitful work, we go through each tool, fix the distance, height, antenna power, drone and its type, fix everything that flies and at what distance it has fallen. Then we write it all into the protocol, and our military already have a clear result, and then they conclude that they need.</p><p><strong>- What can you tell you about your reb and Rer tools?</strong></p><p>- We have portable and stationary remedies. Portables are used directly in the trenches, for combat equipment we put our counter-fpv on Abrams and Bradley. There are remedies with directional antennas - it is essentially antitrone guns.</p><p>They have a more dense opening chart and can, accordingly, work. There are means that make a conditional dome. These are agents that protect a certain perimeter. They are directed against two types of drones that operate at certain frequencies.</p><p>By December 2023, the number of enemy drones at these frequencies was almost 99%. Then we tested our counter-FPV together with DShV units, but we were told that such tools were needed for people. This is how our backpack backpack appeared.</p><p>It is designed to protect a group of people. As soon as the military is told that the enemy drones will appear at the new frequencies, we immediately order our manufacturers components and prepare new test versions of radio -electronic fighting tools to immediately be ready to fight the "bird" of the enemy.</p><p>We also have Kraken counter-fpv that "closes" any drones at certain frequencies. We have already passed these tests, and the state will buy these remedies massively. Stationary HRBs are used to protect critical infrastructure, important objects and positions.</p><p>These are extremely powerful remedies for electronic wrestling, they work from the network. Depending on the power, they can work up to 10 kilometers. Such agents can be used in open areas: refinery, nuclear power plants, fuel storage warehouses. This direction is also quite well established.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-554724" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_554724" style="width: 1500px"><img alt="" class="wp-image-554724 size-full" height="1257" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T06-48-00-08-00/000003.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-23T06-48-00-08-00/000003.jpeg" width="1500"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-554724">Photo: Olga Vikarchuk / Armyinform</figcaption></figure><p><strong>- Nowadays, the big problem is Shakhda. Do you have to work on them?</strong></p><p>- Yes, we work. However, this issue is quite debatable. Shahaned is moving in radio electronic silence mode. That is, it does not radiate or receives any signals. So, to prevent anything.</p><p>First, there are some checkpoints on which Shahaned is conquered with the satellite and receives a signal from him to coordinate his movement. Secondly, when it comes to attack 2-7 kilometers (depending on target and terrain), it connects to GPS in order for the impact to be as accurate as possible.</p><p>Now the military noted that the "chew" has become quite accurate. Accordingly, if at this point when he goes on attack, make him a hindrance and break the signal, then he either swore in search will not hit your target. Yes, it will fall and explode, but it will not hit its target.</p><p><strong>- How does the enemy change his drones and at what frequencies work?</strong></p><p>- Radioelectronic struggle was, is and will be relevant. The enemy is constantly changing the frequencies, and in fact those remedies of radio electronic wrestling, which were relevant a few months ago, now they need to be changed.</p><p>Defenders tell us that there was recently a situation where the racists tied a drone for 10 kilometers to the drone - and so the enemy drone was moving. In fact, such things are unprecedented, but if they are, you also need to find outputs, how to deal with such situations. For this we are here, we work for this, because our credo is to save as much lives as possible.</p></div>
