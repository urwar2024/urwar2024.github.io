We never repeat, and if they (RF) change somewhere in their defense about our sea drones, then we, of course, are one step ahead. All your time, you will see everything, ”Vasily Mid was announced.</p><p>In addition, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine told what contribution the SBU staff made to win.</p><p>“Our results testify to this. As of today, since the beginning of the war, 809 tanks have been successfully destroyed. This is all according to video confirmations. In addition, other armored vehicles, regions and so on. It's directly on the front line, ”Vasyl Malyuk said.</p><p>Working with long -range drones, the SBU divided its teams and means of impression in different distances, ranging from the front and further deep into the territory of the Russian Federation by more than 120 km. Thus, the special service attacked 13 refineries in different regions of Russia, because by export of petroleum products, the aggressor replenishes its budget for war. Successful operations of the SBU are the impression of A-50 aircraft at the Magulyshchi airfield in Belarus.</p><p>Vasyl Maliuk also said that the first special operation to blow up the Crimean bridge with the help of a truck with explosives was prepared from March to October 2022. At that time, up to 46 trains with weapons and ammunition passed through this logistics corridor of the enemy per day. To hit the bridge for the first time, the SBU used improvised explosive devices (21 tons of TNT), which were camouflaged as rolls of film, and for the second time – naval drones.</p><p>Both special operations aimed at cutting the military logistics of the Russians on the task of the President of Ukraine. And after their conduct, the Crimean bridge does not function for the transportation of military cargo.</p><p>“There are damaged supports and the so -called" bulls "on which they stand. When they are restored, possibly potentially (the army of the Russian Federation) will still begin to pull their ammunition, then we will tell them "Hi" once again,-Vasily Mid is predicted.</p><p>Yes, at the sea the special service successfully works as the marine drones "Sea Baby" and "Mamai". With their help, 11 Russian ships have already been impressed and the Black Sea is unblock. Today, these drones are used not only in Kamikadze mode, but also for other tasks. They are unique SBU developments that are nowhere in the world.</p><p>Earlier the Armyinform<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/25/u-gur-rozpovily-pro-postijne-stezhennya-za-rosijskymy-korablyamy/">reported</a>that they told about constant tracking on Russian ships.</p></div>
