Therefore, training and training is an important part of the battle everyday life of these "rex".</strong></p><p>As they study, train and hone their combat skills to perfection, intelligence officers of one of the units of a separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo - in the photo report of the Armyinform.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-555250" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000001.jpg" width="1500"/><p>The steel assistants of our scouts - HMMWV.

They hold 12.7 in one point three shots, that is, three balls fall at one point - and only then break through it. Everything else is not terrible. The hammer has a good patency - it will pass where the pickup will not pass, for example. The wheels do not go down completely during the punching, you can still drive 50 kilometers, leaving calmly from the battlefield, - says the commander of the unit Jesus.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-555252" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000003.jpg" width="1500"/><p>During one of the maneuvers, the Browning machine gun was worked on the landfill.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-555253" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000004.jpg" width="1500"/><p>The combat route of these servicemen since the beginning of a large -scale war - Donetsk, Kreminna, Kherson region, Bakhmut battles and more.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-555254" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000005.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000005.jpg" width="1500"/><p>The commander of this unit is Jesus. Senior Lieutenant of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p><p>In an interview, he told why he got that name. According to him, for a long time parents had no children.</p><p>- Well, Dad once, two, three - nothing. After a while, he "pissed" and said, "I give an oath before God that if the first boys are born, then the name is not in honor of grandparents, great -grandfathers, myself, but the name in honor of God, the name of Jesus." And in two weeks the mother calls and says she is pregnant. The second name - Nazarius - was given by the Lviv Brother, you can say so. There were people who are inconvenient to be called for religious reasons, and I was called Nazar, that is, Jesus from Nazareth, -<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVYnbuCneA&amp;t=2s" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speak</a>he.</p><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wtVYnbuCneA?feature=oembed" title="Штурмували 30 км ворожої території на самому характері" width="640"></iframe></p><p>"Some say that everything on earth is so bad that Jesus himself went to the army to serve-sent from heaven," Jesus-Nazarius says.</p><p>Young commander in the army - since 2017. The contractor. Recalls offensive actions in Kherson region and the role of infantry during such hostilities.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-555255" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000006.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000006.jpg" width="1500"/><p>- Prepared. Early morning. Forward, in the infantry. We wedge in the front edge. We are the first, further behind us - the next battalion is entered. Checkpoint, checkpoint, lock. And so on the route, along the Dnieper. This is despite the fact that from that part of the Dnieper there was an enemy artillery, "lancets" - everything was flying. We broke the front edge - and we had only one "three hundred". It is in such a nature ... It was so powerful: we were simply stupid in landing - and they (Russians. - Ed.) There were officers ... Our mouth cleared completely trenches under the*river, and they just flew through the field where they changed , throwing their "two hundred" and "three hundred". After we broke the front edge, then everything was sprinkled with the Russians.</p><p>Jesus-Nazarius says about the motivation to serve as:</p><p>- I understand that this is my land. I am not so worried about myself. I know: if I am not here, if I do not fight, then my family, my acquaintances are catching up. Brothers, sisters who are still school age cannot come and fight. I understand that if it goes here, then they will not congratulate them too, they will fly, they will destroy them ... The Russians will wear everything under zero, then come: "We released." We must fight to keep our future, our loved ones. We must be here, we must resist, we must destroy the enemy, - the senior lieutenant is convinced.</p><p>According to the officer, many people now forget that war is ongoing in the country.</p><p>- We can not win, if people will happen, do not help, "score the bolt", shoot some videos for the sake of Hipu. How do we win here? You come on vacation, look at it. There the line is moving, struck, and then twice moves. How will they get under the Dnieper what will you do? ..</p><p>But the scout officer summarizes:</p><p>- The Russians only expect death in Ukraine. Whoever came to us with the sword, he will die from the sword.</p><div class="fotorama--wp" data-auto="false" data-captiontag="dd" data-columns="0" data-icontag="dt" data-ids="555256,555257,555258,555259" data-itemtag="dl" data-link="file" data-max-width="100%" data-ratio="1.5" data-size="large" data-width="1500"><div class="gallery galleryid-555248 gallery-columns-0 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-1"><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000007.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000007.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000008.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000008.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000009.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000009.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000010.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T07-01-00-08-00/000010.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl></div></div><p>By the way: it was these military who raised the flag of Ukraine on one of the heaps near the temporarily occupied Gorlovka at the end of December 2023 - President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky reported.</p><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ac_1Zzu7tQE?feature=oembed" title="Наші герої – штурмова група бригади імені короля Данила, королівської бригади" width="640"></iframe></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>Photo by Anton Shevelyova</em></span></p></div>
