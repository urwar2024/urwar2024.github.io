And in 2005, the new complexes were completed and received the arms of the LCD, the Armyinfor reports.</p><p>The developers of these weapons declared its purpose as a tool for the fight against armored vehicles, drones, aviation and helicopters of the enemy.</p><p>The KP-SAM rocket for the KP-SAM is made according to the duck aerodynamic scheme: it has aerodynamic steering wheel in the front, and four operating stabilizers behind. The Shingung rocket is equipped with a two -channel homing head.</p><p>South Korean experts have developed a control system and marching engine. As a result, the rocket was able to damage the targets at an altitude of 3500 m, the maximum range of lesions reached 7000 m.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-555289" height="869" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T09-11-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T09-11-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" width="1280"/><p>The fragile-fugural combat unit weighing 2.5 kg is equipped with contact and non-contact blasting. The radius of action of a non -contact blast - 1.5 m. According to the developers, during the testing, the complex showed 90% the likelihood of damage to non -emerging goals.</p><p>The Shingung rocket is launched using a light portable starting installation similar to Mistral MSr. The operator manually manages the PU to the target. The starting installation is equipped with a "foreign" recognition equipment, developed by the South Korean company LIG NEX1, thermal imaging device of a well -known Samsung company to ensure fire management in night conditions and a starting mechanism.</p><p>For transportation, the complex is disassembled into two parts: the first part is a rocket container, the second is a tripod with sights and electronic block. The calculation of the complex - 2 persons. The design of the starting unit allows placement on different media (cars, ships, etc.), which are equipped with special mounting units.</p><p><em><u>Reference:</u></em>Characteristics of KP-Sam Chiron</p><ul><li>The maximum range of fire is 7 km.</li><li>Effective range of fire-0.5-5 km.</li><li>The maximum flight height of affected targets is 3.5 km.</li><li>The mass of combat part is 2.5 kg</li><li>Maximum rocket flight speed - 2.1 makh</li><li>PU of PU - 24 kg</li></ul><p>It should be noted that in order to overcome dependence on imported technologies, the developers have carried out a great deal of work on the localization of production at the enterprises of the South Korean military-industrial complex. And having achieved the desired result, they decided not to limit themselves to meeting the needs of their own armed forces, but also to offer their product in foreign markets.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-555290" height="667" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T09-11-00-08-00/000002.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-25T09-11-00-08-00/000002.jpeg" width="1000"/><p>Romania will become the first user of the South Korean KP-Sam Chiron MAZRC, which is a common effort to modernize army air defense. Official Bucharest last year concluded a contract for these portable anti-aircraft missile complexes with a total cost of $ 100 million.</p><p>The Romanian Army expects the first of these MAZRCs in 2024, and their delivery will take place under a direct intergovernmental agreement.</p><p>However, the conquest of the Romanian market for LIG NEX1 was not simple tasks. As<a href="https://www.defenseromania.ro/romania-becomes-this-year-the-first-country-in-europe-to-own-korean-mandapd-kp-sam-chiron-systems_627425.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">write</a>The Defense Romania Portal there, at first Romania, wanted to buy portable anti-aircraft missile complexes in the open tender.</p><p>There was only one proposal to the final of the competitive selection - the French Mistral 3 by MBDA. But in the end, the Romanian Defense Office abolished the results of the tender, citing that they were not made by any of the proposals.</p><p>Experts suggest that the case could be in the claimed value of the MAZRC. Based on the above indicators, one South Korean KP-Sam Chiron will cost the Romanian army an average of $ 1.85 million per one.</p><p>In turn experts with ICC Defense Express<a href="https://defence-ua.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">compared</a>The above figure with the cost of complexes of a similar class on the example of the purchase of similar weapons of Slovakia autumn last year. There, one Polish PIORUN MAS costs € 1.8 million, French Mistral 3 - even more expensive, € 2.9 million per unit, the Swedish RBS 70 NG was offered at all at € 3.3 million per unit.</p><p>“But justice for the sake, then South Korea for one KP-Sam Chiron asked for € 2.6 million, and with its proposal, too, did not go to the final of the selection, because the Slovaks then elected Polish Piorun. What we can make it that the Southern Koreans have decided to "drop" the price of their complex to better advance their KP-Sam Chiron,-reported in Defense Express.</p><p>In addition, according to experts, the Romanian soldiers could choose KP-Sam Chiron from South Korea, as well as the characteristics of this complex, in some ways, even the Mistral, on the basis of which this South Korean MANA was created. For example, if Mistral has a range of up to 6 kilometers and the height of the lesion up to 3 kilometers, then KP-Sam Chiron-up to 7 kilometers and up to 3.5 kilometers, respectively.</p><p>Moreover, Romania already has a major contract with South Korea for the delivery<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2022/08/02/pivdennokorejskyj-grim-shho-vidomo-pro-sau-k9-thunder/">She told</a>Armyinform, as well as TZP (transport and carriage machine) and related materials to them.</p><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mOFyHgfiJnM?feature=oembed" title="신궁" width="640"></iframe></p><p>Simulative video use of KP-Sam Chiron MSR.
