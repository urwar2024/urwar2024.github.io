In fact, they do not use the rest of the time, \u201dthe Navy spokesman said.</p><p>According to him, there can be several reasons.</p><p>\u201cOf course, one of them is problems with the equipment to load these missiles that still remains in the Crimea. Ships are actually cut off from this download system. In Crimea, they are not now based. Especially rocket launchers. The exception is the cyclone ship. We say about it as a ship cover, \u201dDmitry Pletenchuk said.</p><p>At the same time, he expressed surprise that the Russians have not yet established a system of loading these missiles into Novorossiysk.</p><p>\u201cIt is surprising that they have not solved this problem yet. Because to deliver, in principle, \"calibers\" to the same Novorossiysk is not a problem. They only have a problem with loading. And why the country, which calls itself a \"switch\", has not yet found the appropriate size of the crane in order to do it - it actually causes a little surprise, \" - said the spokesman of the Navy of the Armed Forces.</p><p>At the same time, he emphasized that such a situation \"lasts forever\".</p><p>\u201cOf course, the enemy tries to solve this problem. But most likely, except for the load problems directly, they have some other problems, perhaps with production, \u201dDmitry Pletenchuk added.</p><p>As reported by the Armyinform, on March 25, 2024, also spokeswoman for the South of Ukraine forces Colonel Natalia Humeniuk<a href=\"https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/25/nataliya-gumenyuk-poyasnyla-vidsutnist-kalibriv-u-vorozhyh-udarah/\">commented</a>The lack of \"calibers\" among rockets that Russian invaders strike in Ukraine.</p><p></p><p></p></div>", "source": "https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/25/u-vms-zsu-nazvaly-dyvnoyu-sytuacziyu-z-rosijskymy-kalibramy/", "title": "In the Navy of the Armed Forces called the strange situation with Russian \"caliber\"", "description": "Dmitry Pletenchuk gave his comments during the live broadcasting of \"One News\" ...", "author": ["Army Inform"], "categories": ["\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438"], "tags": ["\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e \u041f\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0443\u043a"], "source_name": "ArmyInform"}
