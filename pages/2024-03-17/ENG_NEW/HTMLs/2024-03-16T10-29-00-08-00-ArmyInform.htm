Intimidation, bribery, pressure - basic methods.</strong></p><p>About this<a href="https://gur.gov.ua/content/mozhemo-i-ponad-dvisti-vidsotkiv-putinu-namaliuvaty.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">informs</a>MOV General Directorate, reports the Armyinform.</p><p>In the temporarily occupied parts of Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions, representatives of the Russian occupation authorities, accompanied by armed military and FSBs of the Russian Federation, bypass the homes of Ukrainian citizens to explain to them "for whom they need to vote". At the same time, the occupiers emphasize that they can "draw" their dictator and more than two hundred percent of support, and the result of Putin's "elections" will be unchanged. At the same time, the invaders allow the enslaved residents to understand that the refusal to support Putin will testify to their anti -Russian position.</p><p>It is obvious that the fear of "disloyal" to the occupying power by Ukrainians who, in their view, destabilize the situation during the "election" of the occupiers considerable. Because of this in Kherson region in early March, they organized filtration measures, during which they detained "unreliable" Ukrainians. The main criterion for this is the lack of a passport of the Russian citizen.</p><p>Under the pressure of the "election" farce, Ukrainian entrepreneurs and educators continue to be in enslaved lands. One in the case of refusal to "support" Putin, the invaders threaten to deprive entrepreneurship. Others are intimidated by liberation. To the pensioners for the Kremlin agents of another "agitation approach" - they are trying to "vote" with bribery and deception about "better life" and "social payments".</p><p>Despite the pressure and repression by the Russian occupation troops, residents of enslaved territories do not want to participate in the illegal legitimization of Putin's reign. Most people resist the invaders, closing their homes and trying to prevent the representatives of the so -called "mobile polling stations" in every possible way.</p><p>Earlier the Armyinform<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/15/ony-uzhe-v-grajvorone-koz%d1%8bnku-vzyaly-uzhe-vot-%d1%8dty-derevny-glotova-perehoplennya-gur/">reported</a>that the General Directorate of Intelligence has released another interception of the occupiers in which they discuss hostilities in the Russian Federation.</p></div>
