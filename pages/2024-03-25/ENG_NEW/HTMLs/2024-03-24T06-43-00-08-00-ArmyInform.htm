At least in this we are convinced by Russian historians.</strong></p><p>The whole military history of Muscovy is the story of fools headed by its armies. You can start at least from Emperor Peter I. Tsar, who was very fond of fighting, to put it mildly, he could not. The famous battle under Narva proved it. The Little Swedish Army managed to defeat several times the larger Army of Peter.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-554951" height="548" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T06-43-00-08-00/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T06-43-00-08-00/000001.jpg" width="1000"/><p><strong>Article "Charles XII under Narva in the fall of 1700: testimony of close ones", SA Chirkin:</strong></p><p><em>“… Unable to withstand the pressure, the Division of I. Yu. Trubetsky and OM Golovin rushed to the bridge across the Narva River, which was destroyed. At this time, Sheremetev's cavalry, instead of entering the Swedes into the flank, tried to overcome the river with water. As a result, up to a thousand riders drowned. Panic engulfed the Russian camp: the command lost its management, and the officers who were confused did not know what to do. Fleaking from beating his own soldiers, Commander -in -Chief of Duke de Crum with his headquarters surrendered to General Shtenbok… ”</em></p><p>The "brilliant" Field Marshal Sheremetyev, who drove his cavalry in the Battle of Narvsky, losing another one - under the hemaurthoff. The commander then decided to attack without waiting for infantry and artillery. Summary of such a suicide maneuver is a catastrophic defeat and thousands of dead.</p><p>Peter himself wanted to prove himself as a warlord. The infamous Prut hike - completely and completely his idea. The king then - not wanting to give anyone glory - he headed a hike to the south, against the Turks. The hike can be described very briefly. The king led the army to the south, gradually losing the soldiers from the heat, famine and illnesses-until he eventually started them in the environment and signed a shameful peace.</p><p>No, of course, talented generals in Russia were also born. However, the names of good commanders, such as Rumyantsev and Suvorov, are rather an exception among the candid beaver, which were 90 percent of the imperial commanders.</p><p>The following example is from the next Russian-Swedish war. In 1790, the Russian fleet was crashing in the Battle in the Baltic Sea. The Russian Admiral Nassau has lost the battle in Rochenian because he wanted to ... greet the Empress on his anniversary.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-554952" height="788" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T06-43-00-08-00/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T06-43-00-08-00/000002.jpg" width="1200"/><p><strong>The book "Gustav III, 1788–1790”, Lappalainen Yussy:</strong></p><p><em>"Nassau began an attack for a strong southern passing wind in the morning of June 28 (July 9). It was the anniversary of the proclamation of Catherine Empress, and in her desire to celebrate her victory, Nassau did not have time to intelligence, as well as give people a rest and wait for reinforcements. The Swedes won a significant victory. The Russians lost at least 52 vessels. The crews were mostly saved on the islands, of which the next day, hungry, removed and captured nearly 9,000 people. "</em></p><p>By the way, the slave attitude of the Russian generals to their rulers often destroyed their armies. Admiral Nassau burned the fleet because he wanted to make a gift for the anniversary, and someone simply could not contradict idiotic orders. The best illustration is the battle of the Russians with Napoleon under Austerlitz. The battle lost Kutuzov. And he killed thousands of his soldiers simply because ... he did not find the courage to argue with Emperor Alexander I.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-554953" height="739" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T06-43-00-08-00/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T06-43-00-08-00/000003.jpg" width="2048"/><p><strong>Joseph Marie de Mestr, philosopher, politician, diplomat:</strong></p><p><em>“… The valiant Kutuzov lost the Austerlitz battle; In fact, he did not lose it, but gave it to lose. When the Emperor decided to fight all the rules of martial arts, Kutuzov came the day before the night to the Over-Hofmaster Earl Tolstoy and said, "Grared, you are close to the sovereign, I ask you, prevent him from giving a fight, we will be beaten." But by the Over-Gofmester, he almost sent him to the hell: "I do rice and pulyons, and the war is your business." Both warned the eyes of the emperor. They were too good subjects. "</em></p><p>1807. The catastrophe ended with the battle with Napoleonic troops near Friedland. The Russians have traditionally been broken through their commander - the unhappy of General Bennigsen. He managed to collect a whole bouquet of fatal mistakes.</p><p><strong>The book "All the Battle of the Russian Army 1804–1814”, V. Bezotosny:</strong></p><p><em>"He ... did not have time to punches and adequately respond to the enemy's actions. He hurried not to be late and late. He was afraid not to make a fatal mistake and made it, getting into the unnecessary battle of Friedland… ”</em></p><p>The lost Crimean war of 1853-1856 "presented" the Russian history of the shameful commander -in -chief of Prince Menshikov.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-554954" height="754" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T06-43-00-08-00/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T06-43-00-08-00/000004.jpg" width="995"/><p>In September 1854, the battle of Alma lost with a crack. Then, by the way, a subordinate prince, a self -righteous Jolop General Kiriyakov gave birth to a winged expression.</p><p><strong>General V. Kiriakov, Commander of the 17th Infantry Division:</strong></p><p>“Don't worry, your sowing! We throw them hats! ”</p><p>He did not work with his hats - Kiriakov made brilliant in his idiocy, the maneuver, which was included in history. His troops simply left positions and heights and went away. Kiriyakova, who gave absolutely crazy order, was found only after serious searches. He was in an inadequate state.</p><p><strong>General VUNSh, Chief of Staff of the Russian Army:</strong></p><p><em>“After some other space, we met General Kiriyakov in the Valley, the hiking. When asked where his troops, he could not answer, except the words that ... "A horse was killed!"</em></p><p>There were already two anti-heroes in the Russo-Japanese war of 1905. At sea - Admiral Rozhdestvensky, who drove the Russian fleet in the battle of Tsusima, on land - General Kuropatkin. But if Rozhdestvensky lost one battle, albeit catastrophic for Russia, the timid and indecisive Kuropatkin "got" a few defeat at once.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-554955" height="1367" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T06-43-00-08-00/000005.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T06-43-00-08-00/000005.jpg" width="2048"/><p>The defeat of Moscow was especially difficult for Moscow - then twenty thousand Russian soldiers were captured by the Japanese. Only after a series of failures did she resign in general in general. And without recognizing their mistakes.</p><p><strong>The book "Kuropatkin and its assistants. Teachings and conclusions from the Russo-Japanese War ”, E. Tettau:</strong></p><p><em>“… Undoubtedly, all Russian chiefs, without exception, usually diminished their own strength and always saw the advantage of the enemy's strength everywhere. And did General Kuropatkin himself do otherwise? Why did he constantly retreat to the weaker opponent? Why was he afraid of vigorous actions to take the initiative and go on the offensive? After all, this is explained only by the fact that he himself did not have the power of the spirit, that he was constantly exaggerating the forces of the Japanese and fearing them. "</em></p><p>By the way, it was the two neither outstretch that have determined the course of the First World War for Russia. General Yakov Zhilinsky and the commander of the 2nd Army General Samsonov, the commander-in-chief of the Army of the North-Western Front, was in fact lost.</p><img alt="" class="vimg alignnone wp-image-554957 size-full" height="2048" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1562px) 100vw, 1562px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T06-43-00-08-00/000006.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T06-43-00-08-00/000006.jpg" width="1562"/><p>All because of the offensive in East Prussia. According to the ambitious plans of the Russian command, the Russians had to surround the German 8th army. And at first everything went properly. Victory, fanfare, pathetic articles in newspapers. Everything they love in Russia. However, something went wrong.</p><p><strong>August guns, B. Takhman:</strong></p><p><em>"The food did not come, the soldiers ate intact, the villages were abandoned, hay and oats were not harvested, little could be obtained for people and horses. All corps commanders demanded a stop. "</em></p><p>However, General Zhilinsky persistently demanded that Samson one - to step on. The general continued to go forward. To all this, another vibration of the Russian military genius was added - all operational information from the Russian headquarters was transmitted on the radio open text, without the use of ciphers. The Germans simply read the telegrams of the Russians.</p><p><strong>Max Hoffman, Chief of Operational Headquarters of the 8th Army:</strong></p><p><em>“We had an ally - our enemy. We knew all the plans of the enemy. Thanks to the radio reports, we knew the power of the Russian troops and the exact purpose of each of the Russian units involved. "</em></p><p>In a few days the Russians were completely surrounded and broken. The number of Russian soldiers killed exceeded 30 thousand. General Samsonov shot himself.</p><p>Several decades have passed. In replacement of the monstrous Russian Empire came the cannibal Soviet regime. The Soviet military tradition has absorbed the "best" since the king - it was governed by television, who sacrificed thousands of lives of their soldiers.</p><p>Even in the list of the most unsuccessful operations of the Soviet genius of military thought, the Kerch operation is separately in 1942.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-554959" height="937" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T06-43-00-08-00/000007.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T06-43-00-08-00/000007.jpg" width="1274"><p>It was the horror and tragedy, which was created by two - the unrelated General Kozlov and a faithful associate of Stalin - a member of the Crimean Front Military Council Lev Mehliss.</p><p><strong>The book "The day before", Admiral MG Kuznetsov:</strong></p><p><em>“The commander of the Crimean Front Kozlov was already“ in his pocket ”in Mehlis, who interfered with all operational cases. The chief of staff did not know whose orders to fulfill - the commander or Mehlis. Marshal Budyonny, too, could not do anything. Mehlis did not want to obey him, referring to the fact that he was instructed directly from the bet. "</em></p><p>Such troops quickly gave results. The Germans actually dropped the Soviet troops into the sea. The losses were enormous.</p><p><strong>The book "Mehlis. Shadow of the leader ”, Y. Rubtsov</strong></p><p><em>“… The full tragedy of the painting was later drawn in the collective letter to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Political Workers' Group of 51.47 and 44th Armies: the absence of at least some organizing start during the departure, which quickly turned into a panic escape, terrible crushing at the crossings, mass casualties. "It all happened thanks to the treacherous command of the Crimean front, otherwise it is impossible to consider," - the authors of the letter were brought to the extreme. "</em></p><p>Eyewitnesses say - the sea was then black from the Bezlozhroki sailors who drowned during evacuation. Permanent losses, including the dead in hospitals, amounted to 162 282 people - about two -thirds of the Crimean Front personnel. More than 140,000 people, according to the Chief of the German General Staff of Franz Halder, were captured ...</p><p>What is Russian military traditions? First of all, stability. The talent with the General shoulder straps, headed by armies, seems to be a prerequisite for these traditions. And a large -scale invasion of Ukraine once again demonstrates - there is no such suicide stupidity that a Russian "voivode" cannot go to.</p></img></div>
