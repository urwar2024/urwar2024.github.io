And he remembered him when the Russian invaders tried to capture the Ukrainian capital.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-555186" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_555186" style="width: 1500px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-555186" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T15-42-00-08-00-z000002/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T15-42-00-08-00-z000002/000001.jpg" width="1500"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-555186">Taras Kompanichenko.</figcaption></figure><p>-In Ivan Franko, I found a miracle when the Muscovites' attempt to capture and plunder the Kiev-Pechersk Monastery appeared archangel Michael in the shell and with a sword. He first blinded and then beat the invaders, - says Taras Kompanichenko.</p><p>The artist shared the brigade icon with the current spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Candidate of Political Science Andriy Kovalev, with whom he served in the 112nd Brigade of Terroborons. The brother advised to address this to the famous icon painter Yuri Nikitin.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-555187" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_555187" style="width: 861px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-555187" height="570" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T15-42-00-08-00-z000002/000002.png" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T15-42-00-08-00-z000002/000002.png" width="861"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-555187">Taras Kompanichenko sings during the consecration of the icon (photo: spiritual front of Ukraine)</figcaption></figure><p>- I wanted to write an icon myself, but Andrew refused me, noting that I have many other pressing tasks, so I will work too long. Yuri Nikitin will be able to do everything much faster, ”Taras recalls.</p><p>Therefore, the icon of "The Miracle of the Archangel Michael of God about the salvation of the God-lit city of Kiev from the attack of Muscovites in 1658" for the 112nd Brigade was written by Yuri Nikitin in March 2022. And Taras Kompanichenko sang during her consecration at the Nikolaev Church of the PCC on the Tatarka a song dedicated to the wonderful salvation of Kiev from the Moscow invaders in the seventeenth century.</p><p>However, Taras has several of his own sketches on the plot of the wonderful rescue of Kiev from the Muscovites in 1658 and plans to write his own variant of the icon later.</p><h2>The Intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary-for the 241st Brigade of Terroboron</h2><p>Soon, in April 2022, a 241st separate battalion was separated from the 112nd brigade, on the basis of which they created a separate team. For a long time, the icon with the miracle of Kyiv's rescue by Archangel Michael was used by both brigades of terroborons that had common roots.</p><p>-The icon with the miracle of Archangel Michael was considered common to the 112nd and 241th brigades. We made a lot of replicas, posters and small copies that spread it everywhere. However, later the idea was to write for the 241st Brigade of its own icon,-says the artist.</p><p>Several variants were selected, including early Christian Holy Theodore Tyron and Theodore Stratilat, as well as the canonized PCC as a saint in the face of the faithful hetman Petro Konashevich-Sahaidachny. In the end, they stopped on the cover of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and this time Taras Kompanichenko firmly took up the brigade icon.</p><img alt="" class="vimg alignnone wp-image-555188 size-full" height="1361" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T15-42-00-08-00-z000002/000003.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T15-42-00-08-00-z000002/000003.jpeg" width="900"/><p>- I worked on sketches, on different versions. I wanted to write in a modern-style style, a la Ukrainian style and secession of the early twentieth century. So it came out. Since we relied on the Byzantine tradition, we have a certain combination of neo -visantism and Ukrainian style, - says Taras Kompanichenko.</p><p>In the icon, he notes, the traditions of the image of the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Our Lady of Oranta are combined. Its historical and legendary roots have a deep basis, reaching the time of the first baptism of Russia during the time of Kievan Prince Askold in the 19860s. This emphasizes the historical and spiritual gravity from Ukraine-Rus of the 9th century to the Cossack era and modernity.</p><p>- In addition to the image of the Blessed Virgin, the icon depicts the trident of St. Prince Vladimir and the sign of our brigade - a tense bow. It is one of the first heraldic signs of Kiev and at the same time a reminder that our ancestors, when doing peaceful affairs, always had alert. After all, they lived on the front, at the border, where they were waiting for danger, - the icon painter emphasizes.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-555189" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T15-42-00-08-00-z000002/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T15-42-00-08-00-z000002/000004.jpg" width="1500"/><p>The icon of Taras Kompanichenko fell in a holy place-in one of the towers of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra. He was able to do this in the evenings, after lectures for rehabilitation brothers.</p><figure class="kg-card ai-readalso-card"><a class="ai-readalso-container" href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/19/moralnyj-kompas-ne-shybyv-obydva-moyi-syny-vyrishyly-pity-u-vijsko-taras-kompanichenko/" target="_blank"><div class="ai-readalso-content"><div class="ai-readalso-title">"The moral compass did not flash: both my sons decided to go into the army" - Taras Kompanichenko</div></div><div class="ai-readalso-thumbnail"><img alt="«Моральний компас не схибив: обидва мої сини вирішили піти у військо» — Тарас Компаніченко" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T15-42-00-08-00-z000002/000005.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-24T15-42-00-08-00-z000002/000005.jpg"/></div></a></figure><p>After the consecration of the icon was taken to the battalions of the brigade. These visits were one of the right reasons to communicate with the fighters, in particular, to talk about the ancient roots of the Ukrainian spiritual tradition, little known against the backdrop of the reproached Russian church-religious mythology.</p></div>
