For the first time in two years of a large -scale war.</strong></p><p>“We go on vacation. We go out with a high head. In two years of confrontation, the rotation is finally. We will gain strength to beat the enemy again, ”the brigade said at that time.</p><p>How is the brigade restored? What do the fighters do? What do they say about the need to recover people after intense fights? Read and watch in the new photo report of the Armyinform, which presents portraits of history of brigade fighters.</p><p>Having come from civilian (mainly working) professions, they found themselves in the army, left a footprint in history, came out hardened with (without exaggeration) hell, and now - rest and improve to stand up to battle.</p><h2>Calling Bond: It is important for people to rest</h2><p>Bond earlier, before he joined the army in 2021, worked at a forest processing enterprise. He first served in the assault troops.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-560734" height="1071" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000001.jpg" width="1500"/><p>January 14 was injured in Avdiivka. After a few injuries, he says, he became unusable in DShV. Now-in the ranks of the 110th. It's been four months.</p><p>Bond states that recovery is needed for the military.</p><p>- People get tired. The combat situation aggravates people psychologically, morally, physically. It is important for people to rest, change the environment. And after the war, the PTSR will not have such a strong effect if people will be in a more or less quiet environment, get used to the society, adapt,-says the military.</p><p>Bond invests in the gym.</p><p>- You need to bring yourself into a good physical shape, - he says with a smile.</p><h2>Call "Mayor": should be adequate load and adequate recovery</h2><p>And this military before the war was engaged in insulation of the facades.</p><p>- The war began - we must go. It was my weighted consolidated decision, - he recounts his motivation to join the ranks of defense forces.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-560735" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000002.jpg" width="1500"/><p>He also emphasizes that the restoration of military and rotation is needed.</p><p>- Because you are constantly in the conditions of combat stress - it is exhausting, burning, and there is no strength to the inner resistance. Personally, it is driven into depression, difficult emotionally. Although someone may have a larger margin. There should be adequate load and adequate recovery, - he says.</p><p>In his spare time, the mayor reads (military topography and psychological literature), play games and enhances its qualification level in the field of tactics and military leadership.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-560738" height="1071" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000003.jpg" width="1500"/><h2>Calling "Ded": After the contusions should be treated - "Kukukha floats" specifically</h2><p>Prior to the war, Ded worked in the construction sphere, but with a large -scale invasion of Russians and during the fighting for Avdiivka it was necessary ... to go on storms.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-560739" height="1071" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000004.jpg" width="1500"/><p>Now, during the recovery, the military is training a lot in his spare time and pulls up knowledge of medicine.</p><p>- It is good that you can find everything on the Internet. Main wish. We need to learn and develop. There will be nothing - there will be nothing, - he says.</p><p>Military agreement with their colleagues: people need to rest morally.</p><p>- I would like psychologists to do normally after withdrawing the unit from combat; To send people to be treated. Because after the injury, it is necessary to be treated - "Kukukha floats" specifically, - he says.</p><h2>Calling "Pumba": with sawmills re -qualified into intelligence</h2><p>Until February 24, 2022, Pumba worked on a sawmill. In addition to conscript service, there was no combat experience.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-560740" height="1071" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000005.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000005.jpg" width="1500"/><p>And for two years the military in the army. In his account, in particular, the defense of Avdiivka.</p><p>- First, the assault, combat missions ... Then I was retrained, now in a separate unit we are engaged in covering our boys, - he says.</p><p>With brothers unanimous: recovery is important.</p><p>- We need to rest. It is morally difficult to stay at zero. I am already silent about fatigue, - he notes.</p><p>During the rest of the "Pumbba" finds time for movies, reads news, and yet:</p><p>"I like to watch a video of how our opponents break," he adds, laughing trickly.</p><h2>Calling "Beast": On recovery everything is as for the first time</h2><p>Prior to the large-scale invasion of Russians, "Beast" served in the 72nd separate mechanized brigade named after Black Zaporozhians.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-560742" height="1071" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000006.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000006.jpg" width="1500"/><p>When asked in 2014, he answered with laughter: "He studied in college."</p><p>Now, after heavy battles and difficult (and invaluable) experience - rest.</p><p>- You need to recover. Because not everyone can spend so much time in places where ... no need to be. Hard. On recovery everything is for the first time. We get used to again, - the warrior shares.</p><p>More photos from the recreation days of the 110th brigade-in the report 👇</p><div class="fotorama--wp" data-auto="false" data-captiontag="dd" data-columns="0" data-icontag="dt" data-ids="560743,560744,560745,560746,560747,560748,560749,560750,560751,560752,560753,560754" data-itemtag="dl" data-link="file" data-max-width="100%" data-ratio="1.5" data-size="large" data-width="1500"><div class="gallery galleryid-560730 gallery-columns-0 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-1"><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000007.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000007.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000008.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000008.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000009.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000009.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000010.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000010.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000011.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000011.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000012.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000012.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000013.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000013.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000014.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000014.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000015.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000015.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000016.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000016.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000017.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000017.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000018.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-21-00-08-00/000018.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl></div></div><p><span style="color: #999999;">Photo by Anton Shevelyova</span></p></div>
