Therefore, when going to a contract or mobilizing, you should be prepared for a thorough professional medical examination.</span></p><h2><b>Will have to spend from 2 to 4 days</b></h2><p><span>From the obvious disadvantages - it will not be possible to pass the VLK lightning, it will take you several - at least two to four - days of time. This is inevitable because the results of the tests do not occur instantly - in many cases they are only provided the next day.</span></p><p><span>In addition, some additional documents will be required to pass the VLK. If you prepare them in advance, it will accelerate the process. In the absence, you will have to spend time on their receipt. Accordingly, it will slow down your movement - and instead of two days on the passage of VLK will have to spend already 3</span><i><span>–</span></i><span>4.</span></p><h2><b>Contractors and mobilized - green street</b></h2><p><span>A positive factor that will accelerate the passage of HCP to contractors and mobilized is the priority opportunity to get to the commission doctors. Green Street is valid from the moment of registration and allows you to undergo an inspection of all VLK specialists on the first day for several hours.</span></p><p><span>This will allow the same day (or the next day in the morning, if required by the medical procedure) to pass the necessary tests and give the time to receive additional necessary documents if you have not prepared them in advance. In this case, the employees of the VLK will provide clarification on any issue that will be unclear to you.</span></p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-560763" height="872" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-59-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T06-59-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" width="1280"/><h2><b>Starting document</b></h2><p><span>At the beginning of the VLK, you will be issued a document called "Survey and Medical Examination Card" (</span><a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/file/text/108/f277457n5735.docx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Appendix 13</span></a><span>to the order of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine</span><a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/z1109-08#n2847" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span>№ 402 dated 08.08.2008</span></a><span>with changes made in accordance with the Ministry of Defense Orders</span><a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/z1054-14" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span>№ 524 dated 12.08.2014</span></a><span>,</span><a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/z1467-23#n1938" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span>№ 490 dated 18.08.2023</span></a><span>).</span></p><p><span>Note that it will require a 3x4 cm photo card. The examination and medical examination card will be entered during the examinations and as a result of analyzes and research.</span></p><h2><b>What documents can be prepared in advance</b></h2><p><span>In order to speed up the passage of VLK, it is necessary to prepare three documents in advance, the presence of which on the first day of passing the VLK will significantly accelerate the process. How to get them can be explained by the family doctor with whom you have a declaration.</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Certificate of passing previous, periodic and extraordinary psychiatric examinations, in particular for the use of psychoactive substances (form 100-2/o)</span></li><li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Help from skin and venereological dispensary (together with a copy of the micropraitation reaction with cardiolipin antigen (RW))</span></li><li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Help from the TB dispensary (together with a copy of the radiological (fluorographic) study of chest organs)</span></li></ul><p><span>The absence of prepared certificates will not be an irresistible obstacle, but the process of passing the VLK will slow down somewhat - in two days it is definitely not time.</span></p><p><span>How and where these documents can be obtained, they will be told in VLK.
