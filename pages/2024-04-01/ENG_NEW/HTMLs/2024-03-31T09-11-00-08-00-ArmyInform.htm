To achieve this, SAAB will cooperate with FMV, Swedish armed forces, FII Swedish Agency, GKN Aerospace and other industrial partners.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-560386" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_560386" style="width: 1280px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-560386" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T09-11-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-31T09-11-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" width="1280"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-560386">Gripen aircraft of the Swedish Air Force.

This means that we will continue to offer innovative solutions to meet the future operational needs of the Swedish Armed Forces and other customers, ”Zona Militar says the words of the SAAB Director of Larsman Aeronautics Director of SAAB.</p><p>It is noted that the famous Swedish aircraft manufacturer intends to continue to develop cooperation with interested parties working on new and breakthrough technologies that will play an important role in promising combat aircraft systems.
