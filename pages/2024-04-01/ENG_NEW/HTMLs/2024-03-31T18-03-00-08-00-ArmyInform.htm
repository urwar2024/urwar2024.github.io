More than 100 soldiers were also recognized, who directly committed military crimes.</strong></p><p>About this<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1225279995521566" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a>in the National Police of Ukraine.</p><p>“The city was in occupation for 28 days. The abduction, torture, rape, looting and murder of civilians, including children, is not a complete list of the Russian military. Ukrainian police carefully documented these military crimes for the International Criminal Court, ”the report reads.</p><p>Investigators interviewed hundreds of witnesses and victims, conducted hundreds of interrogations, experiments and examinations of the place of events, studied data from external surveillance cameras. This made it possible to obtain a huge array of information about the units of the Armed Forces of Russia in Bucha: full questionnaires, data on positions, demarcation on platoons and departments, weapons and equipment information, places of residence, contact phones and their relatives.</p><p>“Police have already identified more than a thousand Russian soldiers, which in late February 2022 invaded Bucha. The information obtained allowed us to impose the routes of the occupants with a specific time and place, which in turn made it possible to identify the finding of a particular unit at the crime scene during its commission. We were able to disassemble the full structure of the percussion groups of the occupiers of the so-called BTGR (battalion-tactical groups), the structure of their management, types and delineation of equipment and weapons, ”said the senior National Police investigator in particularly important cases, Ivan Dulkai.</p><p>Therefore, investigators have already installed more than a hundred Russian military who directly committed military crimes in Bucha, and know every Russian commander who gave criminal orders to the destruction of Bucha and its inhabitants.</p><p>"We make every effort to ensure that the Russians respond to every Ukrainian tear, and the specified communication has been proven and issued as a prosecution of the Supreme Management of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in court," Ivan Dulkay emphasized.</p><p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/31/u-buchi-pislya-deokupacziyi-vyyavleno-422-tila-vbytyh-rosiyanamy-myrnyh-zhyteliv/">Recall</a>422 bodies killed by civilians killed in Bucha after de -occupation.</p></div>
