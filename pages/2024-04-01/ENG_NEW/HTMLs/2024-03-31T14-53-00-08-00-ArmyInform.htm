But Tu-160 aircraft-have not been used for a long time.</p><p>"No one saw the aircraft Tu-160 on combat missions for a long time," said GUR Chief.</p><p>TU-22 aircraft, according to Kirill Budanov, the enemy is quite limited use of X-22 missiles.</p><p>"Once a week, no more. In principle, they have big problems. In their documents on the Tu-22, they directly write that it is necessary to finish off their resource and, in principle, forget about this type of aviation," Kyrylo Budanov said.</p><p>When asked by the presenter, and when the enemy finishes the TU-22 operation, from which aircraft they will run the X-22 missiles, the GUR chief noted that the enemy can find a technical solution and even equip under it Tu-160.</p><p>“Technically, I think you can find some solution. In addition, the Russians upgraded X-22 and made on its basis the X-32 missile, which has been used several times. I think they will be able to adapt it to the Tu-95 or Tu-160 platform if they can use them. Because I repeat again: rockets are launched exclusively Tu-95. And Tu-160 is not used-their resource is preserved as much as possible, ”Kirill Budanov emphasized.</p><p>Tu-160 (according to NATO codification: Blackjack, was named "White Swan" among the pilots)-a Soviet and Russian supersonic strategic bombard-rocket launcher with a variable wing.</p><p>As reported by the Armyinform, Kirill Budanov<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/31/kyrylo-budanov-prokomentuvav-vykorystannya-rosiyanamy-bomby-odab-1500/">commented</a>the use of the ODAB-1500 bomb by the Russians.</p></div>
