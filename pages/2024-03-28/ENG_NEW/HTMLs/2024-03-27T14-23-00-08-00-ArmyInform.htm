Priority tasks of countries in this direction by 2030 are conducting mutual joint operations (which will include, in particular, the involvement of civilian sector and prospective technologies), as well as the importance of transferring combat IT systems into cloud storage, which have already been checked by Ukrainian military in combat conditions Developers.</p><p class="">“Today, Ukrainian troops use all possible technologies to gain an advantage over the enemy, and at the innovation center we create modern IT products. They allow you to have an informative advantage, to increase the coordination and efficiency of our forces, and most importantly - to manage operations remotely, with less risk to humans.
