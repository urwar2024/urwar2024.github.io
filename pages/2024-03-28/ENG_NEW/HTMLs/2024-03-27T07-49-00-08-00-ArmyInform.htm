You can get it after an interview if your education, professional knowledge and experience meet the requirements for replacing your vacant position.</p><p>After agreeing on both parties, the candidate is provided with a letter of recommendation, which is also called written consent or agreement from the unit.</p><p>It is not necessary to have this document before contacting the CPC for contract service or official mobilization. However, its availability is extremely desirable, as it guarantees that the shopping center of the joint venture or training center will send you to pass the service to the military unit and to the positions specified in the letter of recommendation.</p><p>According to<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/14/u-minoborony-rozpovily-yak-praczyuye-novyj-algorytm-rekrutyngu-do-lav-zsu/">explanations</a>The Ministry of Defense on the new recruitment algorithm to the Armed Forces, the Labor Code and the training centers are obliged to send recruits for service to military units of priority staffing strictly according to the letters provided.</p><p>The form of writing a letter of recommendation will be taken care of in the military unit (unit), but it is worth paying attention to the fact that it presents data on your education, previous work experience, which should meet the requirements for replacement of the vacant position, and information about the service in the Armed Forces of Ukraine ( If you have passed it before).</p><h2>Autobiography</h2><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-556040" height="465" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-27T07-49-00-08-00/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-27T07-49-00-08-00/000001.jpg" width="920"/><p>Unlike the letter of recommendation that you should provide for the military unit in which you plan to serve, your autobiography should be prepared yourself. And it should be done in two variants - printed and handwritten. The text of the document, of course, in both cases will be identical.</p><p>The autobiography is in an arbitrary form, but with the obligatory guidance of the following information:</p><ul><li>Full name, first name and patronymic</li><li>Date and place of birth</li><li>Education (starting from school) indicating the time of study in the respective institutions and/or the time of their completion</li><li>Previous places (if any) indicating the position and term of stay on it</li><li>Place of residence registration and (if necessary) actual stay</li><li>Contact phone number</li><li>Information about family members (indicating their full names, names and patronymic, year of birth, place of work and position (if any) and place of residence).</li></ul><p>At the end of the autobiography, it is indicated whether you or your close relatives have been prosecuted and whether they are registered in the law enforcement agencies.</p><p>The autobiography is certified by a personal signature with the decoding of the name.</p><h2>Characteristics (Summary) from a previous place of work or training</h2><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-556067" height="800" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-27T07-49-00-08-00/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-27T07-49-00-08-00/000002.jpg" width="1200"/><p>You should also take care of the characteristics or resumes from the previous place of work or study. This document is also concluded in an arbitrary form with the obligatory guidance of the following information:</p><ul><li>Last name, name and patronymic person who is characterized (resume)</li><li>Name of place of work or study</li><li>Work time (training) at the enterprise (firm, institution, institution, etc.)</li><li>Position (posts) you occupied while working</li><li>Professional experience, professional knowledge, skills and skills</li><li>Personal qualities that influence the performance of professional job responsibilities and establishing relationships in the workforce</li><li>Data on premiums and awards (reprimands or charges) received during work (training)</li></ul><p>The characteristics should be addressed in advance at the place of work or study, as the preparation of this document may take some time. Most likely, your appeal will not be the first, because the practice of concluding such documents is quite widespread, so they will conclude documents according to a known established scheme.</p><p>The characteristics (resume) of the head (responsible person) and the seal at the place of previous work (training) are certified. This should also be done with a copy of the workbook that will be discussed below.</p><h2>Documents</h2><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-556068" height="447" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-27T07-49-00-08-00/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-27T07-49-00-08-00/000003.jpg" width="794"/><p>The following documents are even easier to prepare - these are ordinary photocopies. Their list includes:</p><ul><li>A copy of the passport (ID-passport) of a citizen of Ukraine</li><li>A copy of the taxpayer card (certificate of assignment of identification number)</li><li>A copy of the birth document</li><li>Copies of Education Documents</li><li>Copy of the Military Accounting Document (military ticket or attributed certificate)</li><li>A copy of a marriage or marriage duration document (if any)</li><li>A copy of child/children (if any)</li><li>Certificate of work activity (copy of the employment record)</li></ul><p>The following list should be paid to the last position, as a copy of the employment record should be certified at the previous place of work. You can do this at the same time as obtaining the characteristics.</p><h2>Action and Photo Card</h2><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-556039" height="480" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-27T07-49-00-08-00/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-27T07-49-00-08-00/000004.jpg" width="730"/><p>Two more documents should be generated on the Unified Public Services Portal online. To do this, in the section "Services" should select the "Help and extracts" tab and continue to generate the documents:</p><ul><li>Excerpt on criminal record (excerpt from the informative-analytical system "Accounting for information about bringing a person to criminal liability and availability of criminal record")</li><li>Excerpt about the place of residence (copy of the certificate of registration of the place of residence of the person)</li></ul><p>Completes a list of documents set of photo cards:</p><ul><li>Two photo cards in size 9 × 12</li><li>The standard block of eight photo cards 3 × 4 (six of them will be attached to the Personal Code in the CPC of the JV, others will be needed to pass the Military Medical Commission)</li></ul><p>About what documents will be needed to pass the VLK and how it will happen - read in our next material.</p></div>
