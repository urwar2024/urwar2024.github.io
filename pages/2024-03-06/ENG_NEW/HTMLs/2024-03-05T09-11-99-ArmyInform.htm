Subsequently, General Atomics was chosen to move to the next stage, which included the creation and flight tests of the device.</p><p>The first XQ-67A flight was based on General Atomics Grey Butte flight control. The purpose is both the overall design of the design and the special emphasis on OBSS. When the glider is recognized as ready, it will be installed sensors, autonomous avionics and other systems and a payload.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-547536" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_547536" style="width: 1280px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-547536" height="649" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T09-11-99/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T09-11-99/000001.jpeg" width="1280"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-547536">Unmanned XQ-67A.

From his photos, experts concluded that this is the Middle Plan. In general, the new UAV is similar to the famous shock drone MQ-20 Avenger from General Atomics and unmanned aircraft MQ-25 Stingray from Boeing.</p><p>The XQ-67A received a three-fold chassis, the V-shaded plumage and a wing with a small angle of boom. The XQ-67A engine is located at the top of the fuselage. Also on the apparatus were noticed panels, which can be antennas of radar of the lateral inspection.</p><p>XQ-67A was created so that it was relatively cheap production with high potential for modernization. On its basis it is planned to develop both shock and reconnaissance types of drones. According to the program manager, this will provide an alternative approach to the purchase of real aircraft and will help you speed up development and reduce costs.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-547537" height="670" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T09-11-99/000002.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T09-11-99/000002.jpeg" width="1280"/><p>"(XQ-67A) OBSS is the first type of drone that flies using a common chassis core developed by GA-ASI, which contributes to the unification of several types of aircraft," said Vice president of GA-ASI under the advanced programs Michael Etwood.</p><p>UAVs should make a number of test flights that include the assessment of the ability of the drone to maintain a variety of intelligence, observation and reconnaissance missions (ISR).</p><p>The drone potential will also be checked using artificial intelligence to strengthen combat air patrol.</p><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B_PgybR7ARQ?feature=oembed" title="Meet the Future of Airpower: XQ-67A" width="640"></iframe></p><p>Unmanned XQ-67A.
