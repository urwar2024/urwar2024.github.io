Currently, the main party of this assistance is heading from Germany. And the first 50 thousand sets are already accepted for warehouses of the Ministry of Defense.</strong></p><p>About this<a href="https://www.mil.gov.ua/news/2024/03/05/medichni-sili-zsu-otrimayut-piv-miljona-aptechok-%E2%80%93-nataliya-kalmikova/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">informs</a>Ministry of Defence Ukraine.</p><p>"Due to the fact that we changed the system of writing off the property, simplifying it to three simple and understandable steps instead of twenty, we managed to restart the process of efficient use of what is stored in military warehouses," - said Natalia Kalmykova, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.</p><p>As it is noted, the innovation should greatly simplify the process of providing tactical medicine for the front.</p><p>“If earlier due to the loss of the first aid kit began a service investigation - otherwise it was impossible to obtain a new first aid kit, despite the presence of MOU warehouses - now it is enough to report to the commander, and he will in turn submit an appropriate request to the financing department. There, the lost first aid kit is written off, thus freeing up a place from a new warehouse, ”Natalia Kalmykova explained.</p><p>The Deputy Minister of Defense also added that, in addition to the first aid kits from Germany, another 300,000 sets are stored in the Ministry of Defense. She assured that after changing the work of the treatment system, the means of tactical medicine are already actively transmitted to the units that need them on the forefront.</p><p>As reported by the Armyinform, Ukraine received from Germany<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/02/ukrayina-otrymala-vid-nimechchyny-50-tysyach-aptechok-dlya-zsu/">50 thousand first aid kits for the Armed Forces</a>.</p></div>
