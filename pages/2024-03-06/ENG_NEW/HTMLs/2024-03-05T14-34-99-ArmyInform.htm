Russian propagandists characterized such epithets of the highest degree of comparison.</strong></p><p>They forgot about one thing in Muscovy: all that verbal tuning is not interesting to Ukrainian combat drones. And the result is a hole sagging at the bottom of the Black Sea.</p><p>"Last night brought another replenishment to the" Underwater "Chiermorskaya Fleet: the non -exit boats of the GUR of the Mou of Ukraine were sent to the bottom near Feodosia patrol ship" Signy Kotov ". So, we have an opportunity to look at the project 22160, ”the researcher of military history, equipment and weapons, Doctor of History, Professor of Hetman Petro Sagaidachny, said in a comment for the Armyinform.</p><p>In the historical excursion, the expert said that since the 1980s, OPV-Offshore Patrol Vessel, patrol vessels designed to protect a 200-mile exclusive marine economic zone began to develop in many countries of the world.</p><p>“Pay attention to Vesel, not ships (Ship). This emphasized the orientation of a new class to perform the military, but let's say, police tasks - to drive poachers, to fine the pollutants of the sea, to save those who have suffered shipwreck… ”, - said the Navy researcher Andriy Haruk.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-547968" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_547968" style="width: 1504px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-547968" height="975" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T14-34-99/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T14-34-99/000001.jpg" width="1504"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-547968">Andriy Haruk, researcher of military history, equipment and weapons, Doctor of History, Professor of the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Peter Sahaidachny.

Kharukuk.</figcaption></figure><p>According to him, in order to reduce the cost of OPV, for the most part, they were built according to civil standards - that is, their survivability is much lower than that of full -fledged warships. They do not also have "normal" weapons - a small gun, several machine guns ... In most OPV countries they are not part of the Navy, but in non -military structures such as coastal security.</p><p>"Everyone has OPV - and we need!" - Yes, apparently, the admirals of the Shishkostan were discussed when they ordered the project of the ship number 22160. What was needed for - a mystery, even Russian around Floci Onithersi could not understand it. After all, such vessels would by definition should be operated by the coastal protection of the FSB, and not Vayenna-Marskim Fleet. But whatever it is, the Navy ordered six patrol ships (so they are classified in Rashka) of the project 22160, " - said Professor Haruk.</p><p>The weapons researcher reported that four of them were building a plant in Zeleodolsk on the Volga, and the last two of the Gulf Plant in the occupied Kerch. By this time, the Chiefnamorsky fleet received four ships-"Vasili Bykov" (2018), "Dmitry Rogachov" (2019) and "Pavel Derzhavin" (2020), and "Sergey Kotov" raised Vayenna-Mari Flag. - July 30, 2022.</p><p>All of them were part of the 184th brigade of water protection ships. Two more ships - Victor Veliki and Nikolai Sipyagin - were laid in Kerch in 2016 and 2018, but have not yet been even launched. They turned into a typical Moskal Long-Building-like, for example, a submarine of the 677th project.</p><p>- So, Andriy Ivanovich, and what are the parameters of this "Analovhonta"?</p><p>- The Project ship 22160 has a length of 94 m and can accelerate up to 25 knots (46 km/h - if you translate into a "land" measure). The architecture of the building and the superstructure is made with a claim for "stels" - that is, its forms should reduce radar visibility. Weapons, as it seems OPV, is symbolic: 76 mm gun and a pair of machine guns.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-547969" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_547969" style="width: 2048px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-547969" height="1581" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T14-34-99/000002.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T14-34-99/000002.jpeg" width="2048"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-547969">The Project ship 22160 Navy of the Russian Federation. Infographic Armyinform</figcaption></figure><p>But the Muscovites were laid in the project 22160 weapons modularity (by the way, for the first time in the practice of Rashkovan shipbuilding). The ship can be quickly stuffed by installing two modules of four winged caliber missiles, turning it into a wolf in sheep's skin. It is well known that in 2020 such missiles were tested for Vasyliy Bykov - for which he was specially chased to the Northern Navy. A helicopter weighing up to 12 tons (Ka-27 or Ka-29) can be based on the ship, and its autonomy reaches 60 days-much more than new Moskal frigates and corvettes.</p><p>The power installation of the project of the project 22160 was performed on the last fashion - diesel of the German company MTU and German ZF reducers. But… 2014 Rashka began aggression against Ukraine and burst into weak, but yet sanctions. German units were still installed on Vasily Bykov, but the rest of the ships had to adapt the "imported" engines of the Koloiensky plant. Well, it is still if the "Mercedes" motor was replaced not even by "Zhigulivsky", but from "Moskvich".</p><p>- And what did the "Sergey Kotov" vessels "distinguished" in the last period?</p><p>- From the very beginning of large -scale aggression against Ukraine the craft of the project 22160 participated in it actively. "Vasiliy Bykov" together with the cruiser "Moscow" attacked Fr. Serpentine. Later, these ships operated in the western part of the Black Sea - until after the mowing and liberation of the Snake RAM, the Black Sea Federation was not forced to take away from these waters.</p><p>They also tried to pirate on the routes of the grain corridor. At the same time, the unfitness of the project 22160 for actions in a real war - above all, the weakness of their air defense became clear. Kozlomord tried to eliminate this drawback, installing on the Helicopter Square "Land" SCR "Thor-M2KM".</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-547971" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_547971" style="width: 2000px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-547971" height="1500" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T14-34-99/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T14-34-99/000003.jpg" width="2000"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-547971">Signi Kotov patrol ship with a "land" SCR on the helicopter platform.

Protetsmo Movie Original: “The small displacement caused insufficient seaworthiness and difficulties with the placement of modular weapons with weakness weapons, especially in terms of air defense, and innovative contours turned out to be so unsuccessful that the ships are inferior even by the armored cruiser“ Boyarin ”. ". In the PIDSUMKU, the Vynna-Mar Fleet, the WID was the planned Budіvnitsa of another sulfur Ships of ProKTU 22160.</p><p>Dmitry Pletenechuk, a spokesman for the Naval-Navy, told the reporter of the Armyinform for the elimination of the Signy Kotov patrol ship "Sergey Kotov".</p><p>- Each such operation is unique because the enemy is constantly looking for ways to counteract. Its main uniqueness was that "Sergei Kotov" had to be a more progressive project in which they had already tried to use a modular weapons system as on NATO ships. That is, theoretically, the systems should not be radically integrated into the ship, but had the opportunity to replace modules. But this is in theory, - the officer said.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-547972" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_547972" style="width: 1400px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-547972" height="934" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T14-34-99/000004.png" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T14-34-99/000004.png" width="1400"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-547972">Dmitry Pletenchuk, a spokesman for the Navy of the Armed Forces, captain of the 3rd rank.

But further plans are a modular weapons that does not "have analogues in Mire", of course, it did not go. In total, there were four such patrol ships in the Black Sea Fleet. Two of them are now actually derived from the line.</p><p>"Sergey Kotov", which has now been moved, was not eliminated on the first attempt. He had already been injured before, he was already repaired after past attacks, but today he has become fatal for him.</p><p>The second similar unit that received the damage earlier was Pavel Derzhavin. A few months ago, he received two damage in the coast of Crimea in two days and was forced to leave this water area and went to Novorossiysk. He received damage as a result of remote mine for the Navy of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces directly near the Crimea.</p><p>Therefore, two such units remain in the Russian Federation on the Black Sea. And "Sergey Kotov" was indeed the latest among his "classmates" and became in the course of only the 22nd year.</p><p>“Kotov, one of all, one trifle, what was not beaten with Back (non -exicipal boats, - ed). It was so bad for the third time, ”the Russian Publishki said in a kind of obituary about the loss of this vessel.</p><p>It should be added traditionally: "Next will be!"</p></div>
