Together, they passed the battles in Donetsk region, and now they defend one of the most complex areas of the front near Kupyansk.</strong></p><p>In order to destroy the Russian invaders who went a great invasion of the nanny, Mars left a profitable business abroad and returned to his native Khmelnytsky region. Immediately arrived in the shopping center and the JV, where it was attributed-differently man could not:</p><p>- If I did not return, did not take the weapon, would reproach myself all my life. Now my conscience is pure, - the man shares.</p><p>The defender of Ukraine began military service from the post of Sagittarius. Subsequently, he asked the management to master the case of a grenade launcher - he says, he is very fond of this type of weapons:</p><p>- It is really interesting - coordinates, angular meter, onset. And what pleasure you get when you can kiss the enemy from the first shot! - smiles the army.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-547928" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_547928" style="width: 2048px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-547928" height="1365" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T12-58-99/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T12-58-99/000001.jpg" width="2048"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-547928">«Mars»</figcaption></figure><p>For two years of military service, the man built a great career: after the fighting in the Donbass he received the sergeant rank, occupied the position of chief sergeant of the platoon, then his mouth. And recently, Mars has headed one of the battalion units and expects an order for the first officer rank.</p><p>On the day of our arrival, the commander presented the military award "for military service of Ukraine". When asked "What did the medal get?" Mars modestly replies that the management is more visible. And he just does what every citizen of Ukraine should do - it is bringing our victory!</p><p>The brother, and in combination, the countryman "Mars", a serviceman on the pseudo "Sam" also heads one of the units of the small link. The man says that he received the mobilization summons the day before the Great War began. On February 24, he was already at the door of the shopping center and JV:</p><p>- But so it was that a few days before I applied to replace the passport. Therefore, without him, no one wanted to take me to the ranks of the Armed Forces.</p><p>Sam had to expect several months until service centers have renewed work. As soon as the identity document, he found himself in the man in his arms, he did not delay and arrived in the shopping center and JV with a firm intention - to join the Ukrainian army immediately!</p><p>Shortly after the formation of the Rifle Battalion, where the Armyts occupied the post of Sagittarius, the unit went to the Donbas - to defend the settlement of Sand. Former teachers, waiters, builders gave a decent repel to the invaders, although they suffered losses.</p><p>- We, purely civilians, saw the war there, as it is: artillery shelling, shooting fights, "meat" storms of the invaders.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-547927" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_547927" style="width: 2048px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-547927" height="1365" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T12-58-99/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-05T12-58-99/000002.jpg" width="2048"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-547927">“Seven”</figcaption></figure><p>"Sam" says that it was scary, sometimes there was a sense of hopelessness and boundless fatigue, but a true brotherhood, a thirst for revenge on every dead friend, helped to master emotions - the enemy could not take the sands at the time.</p><p>And Mars recalls that the situation on this section of the front was so sharpened that even in the relative rear, no one felt safe.</p><p>The military recalls the case when, together with the commander, he was transporting a provision. On the way, they were pursued by the enemy "bird": the invaders dropped two shells from the Froud near the car - to the nearest checkpoint, where it was possible to hide, the army reached the bare discs from the wheels.</p><p>Currently, comrades, along with their battalion, defend one of the front areas. I am sure that the Muscovites did not leave plans to capture Ukraine. But the tactics of the orka battle have been changed - instead of "meat" storms they throw Ukrainian defenders from the Russian territory of bones and rockets, beat mortars and artillery. But it is no longer frightened by the fighters, the hellish fire of Donetsk has hardened the "steppe wolves"-at any moment they are fine to give the enemy the answer.</p></div>
