They clearly saw their advantage, but did not take into account one - the spirit and will of Ukrainian volunteers who rose to defend Ukraine.</p><p>\u201cExactly 10 years ago, on March 14, in the morning, from the Independence Square, hundreds of Maidan self -defense fighters went to a training in Novi Petrivka in Kyiv region. They became fighters of the first volunteer battalion of the National Guard of Ukraine. In a few days, volunteer battalions have already been organized in many cities of Ukraine. Yesterday's teachers, doctors, students, entrepreneurs, athletes, and the Avita made their choice - to defend Ukraine's independence, \u201dAlexander Sirsky emphasized.</p><p>He also noted that he remembers the faces in the volunteer battalions in the area of the anti-terrorist operation in eastern Ukraine, he remembers this courage and insane motivation. These are the fighters that every commander, every military leader dreams of. All over the world.</p><p>The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine noted that he would never forget the long queues at the territorial recruitment centers in Kyiv in February 2022. The influx was such that they did not have time to mobilize everyone.</p><p>\u201cWhen commanding the defense of the capital, I ordered the mobilization of all volunteers directly through brigades and battalions, on the basis of territorial defense forces, because I understood that volunteers came to defend their families, their home streets and cities, their country. Looking at those queues, I finally realized that the Russians would not be able to pass a parade in Kiev. Neither three days nor in three months. Never. They calculated again, delaying themselves and the whole world into a terrible war, which will inevitably end the defeat of the aggressor, the defeat of Russia, \u201dthe head said.</p><figure class=\"kg-card ai-readalso-card\"><a class=\"ai-readalso-container\" href=\"https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/14/vin-buv-u-samomu-ilovajskomu-kotli-ta-do-ostannogo-trymav-oboronu-istoriya-dobrovolczya-viktor-kyrgana/\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"ai-readalso-content\"><div class=\"ai-readalso-title\">He was in the \"Ilovaisk cauldron\" and held the line to the last \u2013 the story of volunteer Viktor Kyrgan</div></div><div class=\"ai-readalso-thumbnail\"><img alt=\"\u0412\u0456\u043d \u0431\u0443\u0432 \u0443 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u00ab\u0406\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043b\u0456\u00bb \u0442\u0430 \u0434\u043e \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0432 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u2013 \u0456\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u044f \u0412\u0456\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u041a\u0438\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0430\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-14T08-30-00-08-00/000001.jpg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-14T08-30-00-08-00/000001.jpg\"/></div></a></figure><p>In addition, Oleksandr Syrskyi thanked all the volunteers.</p><p>\"It is with a heavy heart that I bow to the fallen volunteers.
