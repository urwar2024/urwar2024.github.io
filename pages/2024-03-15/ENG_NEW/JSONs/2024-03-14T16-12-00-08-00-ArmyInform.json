After all, time is extremely important at any stage of medical care for a wounded or injured soldier and plays a key role for further treatment. That is why evacuation medical and resuscitation wagons have become an important element for providing quality and timely assistance. I want to thank everyone who joined this extremely important case: railways, doctors, military, volunteers. Your joint actions have saved thousands of lives, \u201dsaid Natalia Kalmykova, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"934\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-14T16-12-00-08-00/000001.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-14T16-12-00-08-00/000001.jpeg\" width=\"1400\"/><p>At the same time, the chairman of the board of JSC \"Ukrzaliznytsia\" Yevhen Lyashchenko noted that the first medical wagon, which has no analogues in the world, was created in early March 2022.</p><p>\u201cThere were no drawings and technical documentation then, but there was a great need for such wagons. Railways and doctors converted the first such wagon in four days. Today, however, the total number of wagons involved in medical evacuation in Ukraine is 62. We thank all the partners with whom we implement this extremely important project. The unique experience of railways, doctors and military gives the opportunity to save lives - and this is what Ukrzaliznytsia has been doing and does from the beginning of a full -scale invasion, \u201dhe said.</p><p>According to Yevgeny Lyashenko, the equipment of medical cars is identical to the equipment of a real hospital. This makes it possible to provide emergency medical care directly during movement, so these cars can transport seriously wounded servicemen who cannot be transported by other modes of transport.</p><p>The cars work in anesthesiologists, nurses, medical violets, orderly and evacuation crews of railways. Medical equipment on board the train makes it possible even surgery while traveling the train in the most critical cases.</p><div class=\"fotorama--wp\" data-auto=\"false\" data-captiontag=\"dd\" data-columns=\"0\" data-icontag=\"dt\" data-ids=\"551556,551555,551554,551553\" data-itemtag=\"dl\" data-link=\"file\" data-max-width=\"100%\" data-ratio=\"1.4989293361884\" data-size=\"large\" data-width=\"1400\"><div class=\"gallery galleryid-551552 gallery-columns-0 gallery-size-thumbnail\" id=\"gallery-1\"><dl class=\"gallery-item\"><dt class=\"gallery-icon landscape\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-14T16-12-00-08-00/000002.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-14T16-12-00-08-00/000002.jpeg\" width=\"150\"/></dt></dl><dl class=\"gallery-item\"><dt class=\"gallery-icon landscape\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-14T16-12-00-08-00/000003.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-14T16-12-00-08-00/000003.jpeg\" width=\"150\"/></dt></dl><dl class=\"gallery-item\"><dt class=\"gallery-icon landscape\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-14T16-12-00-08-00/000004.jpg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-14T16-12-00-08-00/000004.jpg\" width=\"150\"/></dt></dl><dl class=\"gallery-item\"><dt class=\"gallery-icon landscape\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-14T16-12-00-08-00/000005.jpg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-14T16-12-00-08-00/000005.jpg\" width=\"150\"/></dt></dl></div></div><p>For his part, Viceremier-Minister of Ukraine Oleksandr Kubrakov stressed that there are prospects for the number of medical cars not only from the front to the rear hospitals.</p><p>\u201cWe are technically ready to launch wagons before and across the border for the treatment and rehabilitation of our soldiers.
