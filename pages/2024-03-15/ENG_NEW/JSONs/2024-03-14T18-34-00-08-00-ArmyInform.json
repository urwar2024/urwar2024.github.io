Interoperability allows for joint operations in crisis management operations, as part of the NATO Response Force and multinational exercises. Such operations require interoperability at the level of weapons, shells, communication systems, etc.,\" explained Deputy Defense Minister Stanislav Haider.</p><p>Functional interoperability concerns the areas of defense planning, management of defense resources, personnel management, administrative activity and is focused on perspective.</p><p>\u201cNow we have started a new stage of reform in the field of functional mutuality. Because it depends on it, including how we will interact with partners. The Ministry of Defense system goes a long and difficult path of transformation from ineffective approaches to modern standards and best international practices, \u201dsays Stanislav Hider.</p><p>The presence of a real threat requires the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of finding more effective methods of planning and managing resources to develop capabilities.</p><p>\"How will this happen and what are capabilities? Let me give you an illustrative example with F-16 aircraft,\" says Stanislav Haider. \u2014 Aircraft alone are not enough to gain air superiority and conduct operations. In order to effectively plan their use, we need to ensure that we have all the necessary basic capability components, including the appropriate infrastructure, such as runways, hangars, trained pilots and technical personnel, and changes made to the work of air traffic controllers, navigators, and control systems. In addition, it is necessary to plan the proper maintenance of equipment during operation, from technical inspection to the availability of appropriate spare parts and fuels and lubricants. All this must be planned and executed in the shortest possible time.\"</p><p>In order to achieve the ability to develop capabilities quickly and effectively, the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched the project \"Transformation of the Defence Management System\". The project is being implemented under the leadership of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff.</p><p>The project involves representatives of the relevant structural units of the Ministry and procurement agencies, specialists from the planning and resource management departments of the General Staff, as well as experts from the SDA project teams of Great Britain and PROTECT2 Canada, consultants from Lithuania and the US IDA.</p><p>\"We have set a goal in the first half of 2024 to form a target model and a roadmap for the transformation of the capacity development management system. This project is part of institutional changes and is part of the activities of the NATO-Ukraine Adapted Annual National Program,\" said Stanislav Haider.</p></div>", "source": "https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/14/minoborony-i-genshtab-zsu-rozpochaly-novyj-etap-reformy-systemy-oboronnogo-menedzhmentu/", "title": "The Ministry of Defense and General Staff of the Armed Forces began a new stage of reform of the defense management system", "description": "This is stated in a message on the website of the defense department.
