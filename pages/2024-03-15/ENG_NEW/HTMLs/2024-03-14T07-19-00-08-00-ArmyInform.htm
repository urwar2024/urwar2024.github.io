It was on this day of 2014 that the first 500 volunteers of the Maidan self-defense arrived at the Novy Petrivka landfill to form the first volunteer battalion, from which 1 BOP NSU was formed. Kulchytsky.</strong></p><p p=""><p>- It all started in 2014, when my brother went to the Maidan (the Revolution of Dignity) and returned from there in bruising and in a bloody cured jacket. And by phone he said that all is well so we would not worry. Although we were worried and feared anyway, - says Victor's sister.</p><h2><strong>After that bloody “green corridor” we have not seen you for many years</strong></h2><p>Immediately after the Maidan, a young guy or, as his older brothers said, "almost a child" decided to join the volunteer movement and joined the battalion of the special purpose "Saint Maria"</p><p>- Victor was in hundreds of Jesus Christ. We turned out to be the only Vinnytsia fellow countrymen and quickly wrapped. Not everyone could hold such a high moral bar, combining military and religious discipline, and it was easy to do so ... Ilovaysk was ahead. We came from different positions. After that, the bloody "green corridor" we did not see him for many years, because during the rescue of the wounded brother flew into my neck. Later, we saw with him 131 OMBR when Vitya became an officer. I was very glad to see him in this role and rejoiced that we, old soldiers, had a worthy replacement. Then I learned that he died in the Kherson region ... such a devastation, Lord ..., - the former brother of the warrior recalls.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-551155" height="541" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-14T07-19-00-08-00/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-14T07-19-00-08-00/000001.jpg" width="1139"/><h2>Found himself 15 meters before the enemy trench</h2><p>"You know why I do not like sunflowers and can't look at them?" Victor once asked for his wife, during a traditional joint journey on a motorcycle.</p><p>Then the volunteer's wife joked that it was probably due to the fact that she would make her arrange a half -hour photo shoot under the scorching sun in the middle of the field, but Victor's gaze changed ...</p><p>-The man said that then in 2014, the battle line stretched through the sunflower field, which had already grown almost to human growth. Nothing was visible, and no one understood what was happening a few meters from the trench. During one of the outings, Vitya was 15 meters before the enemy trench, and he heard well as the invaders communicated with each other. So he had to sit in those sunflowers until late at night, and then quietly crawl to his own, hoping not to come across a stretch or under fire, - the wife of the volunteer shared.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-551160" height="795" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-14T07-19-00-08-00/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-14T07-19-00-08-00/000002.jpg" width="1200"/><p>According to the woman, Victor was reluctant to tell about hell in which he had to visit ... only sometimes, reflexively, as when meeting with the sunflower field, which caused a number of painful memories.</p><p>- He was in the boiler itself, where he held defense with his brothers until the last. In fact, they were simply thrown at the same time. There was a leadership, ammunition, and even a field kitchen ... Some units took responsibility and left the position on their own. At that time, the Muscovites began to give a "green corridor" and fire our soldiers, - the wife said.</p><h2><strong>Got to positions for several days and nights</strong></h2><p>Victor's unit also retreated through the famous sunflower field, moving exclusively at night. So they got to our positions for several days and nights ...</p><p>Later, the commander of the unit in which Victor fought was detained for betrayal and surrendering positions, but the boys defended him, they say, and then they were also necessary for arrest, because they were all together, and thank him to preserve his own lives.</p><p>- A lot of questions before they began to treat volunteers in society. It seems that only with the beginning of a full -scale war, society remembered who these people were, and evaluated their feat. After all, in fact, all volunteers - heroes. These are first and foremost people who went to defend us and understood all so much earlier than on February 24, - said the volunteer's wife.</p><p>When Victor became a student of the military institute and studied the history of wars more deeply, he often said that the full -scale war would not be missing, and it would be more likely to be in the near future. Such rhetoric guy has nominated constantly since 2018 and called on his former brothers not to relax and bribe the "projectile" ...</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-551158" height="609" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-14T07-19-00-08-00/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-14T07-19-00-08-00/000003.jpg" width="1101"/><h2><strong>Could not fall asleep on the bed because it is too soft</strong></h2><p>In one of the warm summer nights of 2016, during his vacation, Victor came to visit his sister. Again a motorcycle ... Victor loved this type of transport, because when he was at the wheel of a two -wheeled "friend", he felt true freedom he was so lacking in his service.</p><p>- Then we were crushed until late at night, and did not want to disperse. But Vitya had important plans for the morning, so we decided to sleep a little. When I went to wake him up in the morning, I saw my brother on the floor in the bedroom. To my surprised look, he replied that he had a little wild in those fields, and could not fall asleep on the bed because it was too soft. I suggested that he still relax and postpone plans, but he firmly jumped from the floor, and said that we were going, - said the volunteer's sister.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-551156" height="511" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-14T07-19-00-08-00/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-14T07-19-00-08-00/000004.jpg" width="720"/><h2><strong>Ilovaysk and sunflowers</strong></h2><p>The woman recalls that then they were silently arrived in a neighboring village, where a large sunflower field was spread before them. Then Victor asked her sister or remembered his story about Ilovaysk, and she nodded her head. At that time, the volunteer confessed to his sister that he had an acute reaction to the sunflower fields since then, and he could not respond adequately to them, corresponding to the real environment. The man set the sister's task: just to be near, not talk, and not distract, but if he is very "swim", then to do something.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-551161" height="900" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-14T07-19-00-08-00/000005.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-14T07-19-00-08-00/000005.jpg" width="1200"/><p>-Then I tried to offer him to turn to a psychologist, already knowing the negative answer in advance, because my brother believed that a person could be a psychologist. But what was my surprise when he said that if there was nothing in the event today, he would turn ... I would have to betray, but on the contrary, it means that it means that it is very difficult for a morally brother if he is ready to cross even because of her prejudice, - said Victor's sister.</p><p>Then, despite the morning of Victor at the head, small drops of sweat sparkled, a vein fought on the temple, and his hands, then squeezed into a fist, then squeezed again. Brother and sister wandered between sunflowers in complete silence. It is unknown how long this "walk" lasted, but the sun had already risen above the horizon, and only then Victor first uttered the word.</p><p>- He asked me whether I saw the forest, and I nodded my head affirmatively. Then he smiled widely, he said that it was almost shot by the hunters at the age of 9. I then said that despite the strong love, I still want to stuff it with a broom, - the volunteer sister recalls with a smile.</p><h2><strong>At the same time, he was both a soldier who is at war and a physician</strong></h2><p>After a while, Victor still managed to cope with his own reactions that prevented him from living. He also managed to become a real combat officer, whom he sought to be. The volunteer did not want to sit in the rear, collecting awards and praise, and then 30 years later in the medals to head some council and tell the students about the exploits in which he did not participate.</p><p>- In general, Vitya in this ... The military sense was quite modest. Even talking about Ilovaysk. At the same time, he was both a soldier who is fighting and a physician. I think it happened because of his presence, though he had a veterinary, but still medical education. He told little about it, but he often had to collect the remains of his fallen brothers from the shrubs. I remember, somehow Vitya came to me during a vacation and said: Imagine, there is a person with whom you communicate daily, shake dry, fight, and after a while you collect its remains to send your family, - said a friend of volunteer, Taras.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-551157" height="900" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-14T07-19-00-08-00/000006.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-14T07-19-00-08-00/000006.jpg" width="1200"/><h2><strong>Pulled out the wounded brothers</strong></h2><p>The sense of duty, courage and military honor is evidenced by Victor's heroic act at the beginning of a large -scale invasion, just a week before his death. Then the officer, he pulled out the wounded brothers near Oleshok, which in the Kherson region, thus saving their lives.</p><p>On March 12, 2022, a volunteer, an officer, commander, a person who loved his business and the country more in his lifetime.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-551162" height="807" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-14T07-19-00-08-00/000007.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-14T07-19-00-08-00/000007.jpg" width="960"><p>It probably happened near the settlement of Stepova Valley, which in Kherson region, where the man performed the task at that time ... To tell exactly where it happened and to be accurate in the date - it is impossible, because Victor's body rot in the so -called "gray zone" for over a year, for more than a year And for half a year the DNA procedure continued.</p><p>Victor Kirgan was buried on April 20, 2023 in a closed coffin in his native Vinnytsia region.</p><p>Nowadays, relatives and brothers are actively working to preserve the memory of a warrior who devoted to a continuous struggle against the enemy for 10 years, and gave the most valuable thing - his life.</p><p><em><strong>Let us honor the warriors - volunteers!</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Remember everyone!</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Forever in order!</strong></em></p></img></p></div>
