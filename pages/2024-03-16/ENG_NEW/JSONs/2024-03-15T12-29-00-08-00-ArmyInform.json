Therefore, the aggressor country intensified the flow of citizens with countries with a difficult economic situation. Therefore, in addition to prisoners of war, Ukraine faced captive mercenaries from the countries of the Global South. During the press conference: \u201ccaptured mercenaries from the countries of the Global South. What should governments do so that their citizens do not die in foreign war? \u201d Prisoners of war said that they prompted them to come to fight for another's army against Ukraine.</p><h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>\u201cTold me that I could fulfill my dream here\u201d</strong></h2><p>- My name is Adil Muhammed. I'm 20 years old. I came to Russia for a dream: I wanted to improve my family's life and get a job. They (the Russians. - Ed.) Told me that I would be able to fulfill my dream here and transport my family to Russia. So I did not know that I would find myself on the front, without knowledge of language, and for me the only problem that was language. I just didn't understand where I got, - said a prisoner of war.</p><h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>When he arrived in Moscow - sent to war</strong></h2><p>- My name is Dario, I became part of the Russian army because I needed money for my family, and this is the only reason. When I was in Cuba, I was reported that Russia needs a person who would be in construction and work in general. I filled the form, came, but did not realize that I came to war. When I arrived in Moscow, I was sent to the war. Before that, I received my education in the field of teaching mathematics and geography. I taught geography in Cuba, but the money was missing. Then I started playing music, and that's what I really was interested, - said a prisoner of war.</p><h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Promised work in the hospital</strong></h2><p>- My name is Bikash. I am 32 years old and I'm out of Nepal. I have the same story as in others. I got to the Russian Federation through a tourist visa. I was deceived, said that everything would be fine and that I would not go to the front. Maximum promised to work at the hospital or what I will do logistics. Then I decided to go and joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, - said the mercenary.</p><h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>\u00ab</strong><strong>We were left without food and water and I gave up captured \u201d</strong></h2><p>- My name is Richard. I'm from Sierra Leone. I'm from a very poor family. He arrived in the Russian Federation on the application, allegedly for ordinary work. I was called and said they would expect me in Moscow, in the office. When I came to the Russian Federation, I saw that it was a military object. I was assured that everything would be fine, but on the same day we were sent to Rostov by military bus. Once, before we took away phones and documents, I managed to contact my family and explain where I found myself. Then my mother began to cry and say that I was running away from violence in my country, and was in the same violence. We have already been sent to Ukraine from Rostov. We were not taught anything, but were accompanied everywhere. I decided to surrender when we were thrown and left without food and water for 7 days, - the occupier said.</p><h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Poverty at home is much better than dying in a foreign land</strong></h2><p>A representative of the coordination headquarters on the management of prisoners of war, Petro Yatsenko reported that this meeting is a call to citizens of low -income countries - not to join the ranks of the Russian army and not to fight against Ukraine.</p><p>- These people who have been captured are just lucky, because they have saved their lives. Despite the fact that they are, in fact, mercenaries, and according to the Geneva Convention they are outlawed, and can be convicted of mercenary, we still follow the rules. Therefore, as long as the court has not taken place, Ukraine enforce their rights under the Convention. With this meeting, we want to demonstrate the countries that their citizens have been thrown into the front as cannon, because they have not been taught them. So we urge: poverty is much better at home than to die in a foreign country, fighting for a foreign army, - Petro Yatsenko said.</p></div>", "source": "https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/15/obiczyaly-groshi-ta-garne-zhyttya-poloneni-najmanczi-z-krayin-globalnogo-pivdnya-rozpovily-pro-vijskovu-sluzhbu-v-rf/", "title": "Promised money and good life: captured mercenaries from the countries of the global south were told about military service in the Russian Federation", "description": "The front requires fighters whose service life is not measured in days but in hours.
