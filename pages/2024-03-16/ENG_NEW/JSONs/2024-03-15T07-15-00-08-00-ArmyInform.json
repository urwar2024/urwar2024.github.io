At the same time they forgot about the elementary. And - the wars lost. Russian historians themselves claim this.</p><p>When called the causes of Russia's military defeats, the word \"logistics\" is not always in the first place. It was because of the inability to manage their huge armies that the empire regularly shakes military catastrophes.</p><p>In general, problems with logistics in Muscovy are solved from about the Middle Ages. Even in the old days, Moscow warlords have never worried themselves with the problems of the army, especially the delivery of weapons and food.

The war with Napoleon, which Russian historians always describe with tears of firing in the eyes? Almost all movies about that time always end with a pathetic retreat of the French from Russia.
