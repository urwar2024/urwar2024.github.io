And to confirm the person does not require a passport or a military ticket - even photocopies of documents are enough.</p><p>In intelligence, they emphasize that in this way the Russian "election commissions" will try to increase the number of Putin's voters by attracting the so -called dead souls in the "vote".</p><p>In particular, the people who "voted", along with the available servicemen, also plan to add those who have recently died, disappeared or captured.</p><p>Considering that Ukrainian defenders, according to official data, daily cause numerous losses to Russian invaders in the territory of Ukraine, the number of those who in this way will "support" Putin may be quite significant.</p><p>“The Kremlin carries out a whole set of measures for the fictitious holding of the so -called“ election of the President of the Russian Federation ”. Although it is obvious that neither the very fact of this election nor their results is a means of legitimizing the Putin rule either in Russia or beyond, ”the message reads.</p><p>As reported by ArmyInform, the United States<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/15/ssha-zasudzhuyut-rosijski-vybory-na-okupovanyh-terytoriyah-ukrayiny-derzhdep/">condemn</a>Russian elections in the occupied territories of Ukraine.</p></div>
