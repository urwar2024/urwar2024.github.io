They talked about the creation of the unit and its motivation, the development of UAV forces in the Ukrainian army.</p><p><strong>— Andrii, why "Grandpa"? Obviously, this call sign is beyond its years...</strong></p><p>"It's been since the days of reconnaissance to confuse the enemy. But seriously, probably because no one believes I'm 41... I just lead an active lifestyle and have no bad habits.</p><p><strong>— How did you start your career as a military man?</strong></p><p>— Like most Ukrainians<strong>—</strong>February 24, 2022. By that day, I was doing business, raising children. In early February he returned from rest ... And here Putin decided: you live very well. It is impossible to do so, because my slaves will also want it, so let's give you a little. So, I sent the family abroad, I went to the shopping center and TRO. But at that moment people without combat experience (and I did not have it) were not particularly taken. So it was necessary to wait until April - called the staffing center, invited ...</p><p><strong>"What happened next?" Training or service right away?</strong></p><p>- We were sent to the training center. There was a basic military training: tactical medicine, engineering, shooting. The control of the BTR-4E-we were prepared as drivers of armored vehicles, first on simulators, then there were real trips.</p><p><strong>- Did you get into the team at will?</strong></p><p>-All the time, as long as the study, my friend and I were looking for ways to get into the landing team. You see, we went into the army to liberate Ukrainian land. And the storms - they are always ahead! We needed just there! And when the distribution has already come, we were sent from the training center to a separate, at that time mechanized, the brigade of the name of the cat chieftain Ivan Sirko as the drivers of the APC. We then got into an engineering company, which is engaged in the evacuation of equipment from the battlefield. The moon we were pounding there, and then there was an opportunity to get to Code 9.2.</p><p><strong>- Tell us about your unit ...</strong></p><p>- Code 9.2 began as a reconnaissance platoon. It was launched by my commander Flint, who now plans and commands operations, and through which we have such results. Then, all of 2022, we were engaged in pedestrian intelligence and, often, with direct contact with the enemy. Daily 2-3 exits a day: defended Kharkiv region, then preparation for the operation to liberate the region, participate in this successful operation-intelligence is always ahead, then promotion further to Luhansk region-we conducted many successful operations, but without loss did not do ...</p><p>And since the end of 2022, we have switched to the sky, as we have been on the defensive. Foot reconnaissance was replaced by aerial reconnaissance, and we focused on performing certain sabotage tasks with fire damage to the enemy.</p><p>Subsequently, given the effectiveness of the drone bombers, we were agreed by the creation of a separate platoon of the UAV. At the time, there were companies of the UAVs that worked at the brigade level. But our Code 9.2 performed the task at the level of the battalion, and showed its effectiveness.</p><p>At the time of our active development of attack UAVs, the brigade was stationed near Bakhmut, holding the Chasiv Yar — Khromovo — Bakhmut road, the only one that remained then for the movement of our troops. The defense there began to "fail", so we were transferred there so that we could push back the Russians and "hold" this place. And we did it. Then they went further — to the Berkhiv reservoir. We managed to do this precisely at the expense of drones — the same "Mavics" with which we crushed the Wagnerites — more than five hundred individuals in two months. In 2023 alone, we destroyed more than two hundred units of enemy equipment. The number of destroyed occupiers is already in the thousands...</p><img alt="" class="vimg alignnone wp-image-551755 size-full" height="1280" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-15T09-13-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-15T09-13-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" width="960"/><p><strong>- And yet, what is the secret of success?</strong></p><p>- The secret? Motivation. Discipline. Mutual respect. Mutual assistance. Dedication. Constant development. The desire to win and return to normal life as soon as possible. It is because of these simple rules that the unit is so effective.</p><p>We close the brothers from the sky day and night - the orcs simply do not have the opportunity to approach. We destroy their front edge where they can accumulate in order to get on the attack. We beat large armor up to 7-8 kilometers. Now, on the area of our responsibility, the Russians are simply hiding, moving. They no longer have large fortifications, so they can not go to the assaults.</p><p>Code 9.2 is a 24/7 air intelligence, land intelligence, which performs specific tasks, and in fact - percussion UAVs. In the daytime, we exterminate the enemy with the help of "Maviiki", FPV-oules, at night we start drones-bombers, which carry 10 kg of explosives and destroy shelters, armor, equipment or change the terrain. They fly up to fifteen kilometers from the collision line and "clean" everything there. Due to this, our battalion, from January - February 2023, did not lose its position.</p><p><strong>- You spoke of mines with UAV ...</strong></p><p>— Yes, with the help of heavy night "birds", we carry out remote mining of the logistics routes of the ruscists. And more than once, this mining saved the lives of our brothers.</p><p>Here, for example, is such a case... The Russians do not give up hope to drive through the mined roads and attack our infantry. So, the day before, we mined and updated mines in two probable directions of the enemy's advance. At night, there were weather conditions that did not allow aerial reconnaissance, so that night we were without "eyes" in the sky. Around 6:30 a.m., the infantry reports that they hear the sounds of equipment and explosions.</p><p>We were able to raise the birds in just a few hours. With difficulty we come to our positions, then a little further. And we see an epic picture: there are two blown up enemy APCs. On the other way, it is evident that the blast was, but the technique was dragged, whether it drove away ... That is, the Russians, using the weather conditions and realizing that we cannot fly, we cannot see them, we decided to storm them. On the one hand, two cars went, on the other - one. These two APTOs were blown up, they remained in place, the infantry fled. So, with the help of remote change drones, we stopped the assault that we have not even seen and prevented the losses on our part, because when our infantrymen would see the enemy in the absence of visibility, understand where to shoot - it would be late. And, most likely, we would have lost those positions.</p><p><strong>— And what were the biggest losses you inflicted on the Russians in one exit?</strong></p><p>- Once we worked at night with two "copters" - one flies, the other in the stock stands, in case the first is lost. It was a joint operation with one of the friendly units, our friends. Pre -found goals - a technique. They worked one, the second unit. Then they penetrated deeper-and there, as we call, "Zoo": parking tanks, pieces of thirteen to four. We lift the second board - and in one night eleven cars were destroyed. And in the morning, our arts threw, gave ammunition ...</p><p><strong>- In your opinion, do the Russians prevail in the amount of shock drones?</strong></p><p>— I can't say that they prevail. Judging by what is happening in our direction, the ratio of FPV drones is about one to one, no more. In other directions, it may be different... The Russians are not working as actively with drops from Mavics as we are — probably one to five, and they donʼt have heavy bombers yet. But I think it's a matter of time, they will launch them too.</p><p>But in the lancet type drones, the advantage on their side. Just like in the night FPV-zero.</p><p>However, in Ukraine the production of shock UAVs is actively increasing. And he pleases that they are made in small industries, which are able to quickly adapt the product to today's needs of the army.</p><p><strong>- You have the opportunity to turn to our readers ... There is something to say?</strong></p><p>- To stop afraid of representatives of the shopping center and go to destroy the enemy. Currently, the most favorable conditions have been created - the same recruitment, or you can choose a unit and a position by looking, for example, to "<a href="https://thelobbyx.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lobby X</a>”. You just need to change your approach and thinking: you do not go to the state. Just look around now: if you see at least two people who need to be protected, you have to take a weapon in order not to meet the enemy on the doorstep of your home when it is late. Because when this horde comes to you with great strength, you will do nothing.</p><p><em>Photo from the hero's archive</em></p></div>
