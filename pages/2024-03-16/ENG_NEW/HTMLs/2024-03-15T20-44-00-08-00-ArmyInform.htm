After all, the rental price in Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Transcarpathia or in a small town is significantly different.</p><p>Thus, according to a study conducted by the analytical company CEDOS with the support of the Council of Europe at the request of the Ministry of Social Policy, housing prices in Kyiv are 22% higher than the national average (up to UAH 8.4 thousand for a one-room apartment), in Mykolaiv and the Mykolaiv region they are 30-35% lower (do not exceed UAH 4.5 thousand), and in Transcarpathia they are 2.5 times higher than the national average (reaching UAH 17 thousand for a one-room apartment).</p><p>The lowest prices are in Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Kherson regions and range from UAH 2.8 thousand to UAH 4.4 thousand for a one-room apartment, in regional centers in these regions the figure will be slightly higher, from UAH 3.2 thousand to UAH 5 thousand for a one-room apartment.</p><p>Therefore, the lease subsidy will take into account the difference in the cost of housing.</p><p>In addition, the amount of subsidy will depend on the number of persons in the household that rent a home, as well as household income and the ability to pay for rent accounts independently. The lower the income, the higher the percentage of the lease will cover the subsidy.</p><p>In the first stage, the introduction of a lease subsidy is planned for internally displaced persons. In the future, this support tool can also be for other citizens who will need such assistance from the state.</p><p>This project is currently agreed within the government and with the interested authorities.</p><p>The Ministry of Social Policy expects that after the approval of the relevant government decision, IDPs will be able to use the new support tool for them from June.</p></div>
