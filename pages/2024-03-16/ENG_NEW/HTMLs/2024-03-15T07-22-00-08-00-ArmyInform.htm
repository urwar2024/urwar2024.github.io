It was in the Cossack era that the volunteers re -found the national military tradition, which can become the basis for the creation of modern Ukrainian armed forces.</p><p>Therefore, in April 1917, the first Ukrainian Volunteer Infantry Regiment named after Bohdan Khmelnytsky, which eventually grew up and became a structural part of the Ukrainian army.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-551699" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_551699" style="width: 769px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-551699" height="500" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-15T07-22-00-08-00/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-15T07-22-00-08-00/000002.jpg" width="769"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-551699">Vsevolod Petrov</figcaption></figure><p>Soon, the second Ukrainian name of Hetman Pavel Polubotok, the Cossack Regiment, which enshrined the tradition of appealing to the Cossack past as a symbolic model for imitation by Ukrainian volunteer formations of the times of the Ukrainian National Democratic Revolution.</p><p>- An interesting example is with Vsevolod Petrov, who symbolically called his already Ukrainianized regiment with the name of Kostya Gordienko - the first cat chieftain of Zaporizhzhya Sich of Hetman Ivan Mazepa, who brought 8,000 Cossacks to Poltava to participate in the Poltava battle. - Likewise, Vsevolod Petrov brought him a regiment from Niman to the Dnieper, to Kiev, to the Central Rada in order to pour it into the Ukrainian army.</p><h2>Without joining the regular army,<br/>Free Cossacks made a fatal error</h2><p>The striking phenomenon of the first liberation competitions was also the so -called free Cossacks, which formed the mass basis of the Ukrainian volunteer movement. He was mostly joined by peasants, who were ready to fight for free Ukraine at the call of their heart and their ideals, remembering the glorious times of Cossacks-Cossacks.</p><p>- Unfortunately, it was not possible to direct this powerful voluntary gust to the creation of regular Ukrainian armed forces. The peasants thought first of all about the protection of their home, about economic affairs - and as soon as their small homeland disappeared, then they returned to the homes, - explains Tatiana Vidchenko.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-551700" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_551700" style="width: 1814px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-551700" height="1000" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1814px) 100vw, 1814px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-15T07-22-00-08-00/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-15T07-22-00-08-00/000003.jpg" width="1814"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-551700">Delegates of the First Congress of Free Cossacks in Chigirin (October 1917)</figcaption></figure><p>Fatigue was also sustained from the long -term World War I and the propaganda of Bolshevik agitators who erected Ukrainian volunteers in Manivka, offering simple and at the same time deceptive decisions.</p><p>Subsequently, having encountered Bolshevik politics in practice, the peasants were aware of deception and created numerous rebel units such as the famous knights of the Cold Yar. However, it was too late - the scattered armed forces of the rebels were incapable of defeating the state with a regular army of a hostile state.</p><h2>Modern volunteers trained by the mistakes of their predecessors of the UNR day</h2><p>- We are now in a much better situation than our historical predecessors during the Ukrainian People's Republic. We have a state that has existed for several years and, thanks to the tragic historical experience, we know the price of false Russian propaganda well, - says the scientist.</p><p>This makes modern Ukrainian volunteers more conscious, motivated and visionary than historical predecessors. Unlike the soldiers of the free Cossacks, they are good to leave the weapon on the first occasion after the disappearance of direct danger, the fighters of volunteer armed formations are well understood that the state structure is able to defeat only another state structure.</p><p>- Now, unlike the situation of a century ago, state institutions work and there is an internal consolidation of society - there is a clear awareness that Russia is an enemy. This was sharply lacked during the UNR, and because of this she lost. However, the tragic experience has not passed in vain-his lessons served the Ukrainian national liberation movement in the future,-Tatiana Shvidchenko emphasizes.</p><figure class="kg-card ai-readalso-card"><a class="ai-readalso-container" href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2022/10/18/vilne-kozacztvo-teroborona-ukrayinskoyi-revolyucziyi/" target="_blank"><div class="ai-readalso-content"><div class="ai-readalso-title">Free Cossacks - Terroboron of the Ukrainian Revolution</div></div><div class="ai-readalso-thumbnail"><img alt="Вільне козацтво – тероборона української революції" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-15T07-22-00-08-00/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-15T07-22-00-08-00/000004.jpg"/></div></a></figure><p>That is why modern Ukrainian volunteers have strongly followed their historical predecessors, whether by transforming volunteer armed forces into regular parts of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, or joining the ranks of existing units. Undoubtedly, it is an important component of the future victory.</p></div>
