The portable device is quite convenient in deployment. The developers offer power options from both the battery and alternating current, and all the ready -to -work block weighs less than 50 kilograms.</p><p>Aim Defense co -founder Jessica Glenn said that counteracting drones and other autonomous weapons systems is now \"one of the most critically necessary areas for military worldwide.\"</p><p>\u201cIn recent years, AIM Defense has worked with an ecosystem of defense innovations on creating an easy -to -deployed economic, high -precision system. Fractl: 2 is the climax of these efforts, \u201dMs. Glenn said.</p><figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-558131\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_558131\" style=\"width: 983px\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-558131\" height=\"662\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-29T09-11-00-08-00/000001.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-29T09-11-00-08-00/000001.jpeg\" width=\"983\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-558131\">Laser FRACTL: 2.
