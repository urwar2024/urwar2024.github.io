We expect that we will have enough people who can protect their homeland. It is not only about mobilized, but also about volunteers, ”said Alexander Sirsky.</p><p>He explained that after reviewing the number of certain parts that do not participate in hostilities, on the basis of the audit of their activities, there was an opportunity to release thousands of servicemen and send them to the combat units.</p><p>“But at the same time it is necessary to refrain from extremes. All armies of the world have a personnel that does not participate in hostilities but provides combat units. This is no less important part of the work, ”the Armed Forces Commissar said.</p><p>Alexander Sirsky added that the war we are forced to wage against Russian invaders is a war for exhaustion, a logistics war. Therefore, the value of the efficiency of the rear units cannot be underestimated.</p><p>In particular, he said, it is a system of providing troops with food and ammunition, repair units, medical establishments and more.</p><p>"These people are contributing to the efficiency of hostilities," he added.</p><p>Oleksandr Syrsky emphasized that those citizens who come to the troops for mobilization do not get to the front immediately.</p><p>With very special exceptions, for example, when a person already has combat experience, the vast majority of these persons arrive in training military units and centers.</p><p>“The number of people who undergo such training in February this year was 84% of the total number of mobilized. Only after such training can they be directed to the completion of military units to restore their combat capability, ”added the Commander -in -Chief of the Armed Forces.</p><p>Earlier in<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/28/golova-komitetu-z-naczbezpeky-sprognozuvav-koly-mozhe-buty-predstavlenyj-u-radi-zakonoproyekt-pro-mobilizacziyu/">Interview with Armyinform</a>The chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security and Defense Alexander Zaitnevich stated that the presentation of a new bill on mobilization to the Verkhovna Rada may take place in mid -April, taking into account the legal expertise of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.</p></div>
