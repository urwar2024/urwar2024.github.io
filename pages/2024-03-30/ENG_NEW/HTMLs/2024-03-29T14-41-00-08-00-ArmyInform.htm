I, as a big service and good dog (though good only to those who do not violate the law when I patrol), traveled calmly under the supervision of an attendant - my movie engineologist, ”the story reads.</p><p>It is noted that Ermi was traveled to Kiev in Kiev in the redeemed compartment, as provided by the rules.

Railway workers - we all understood, we agreed and went, ”Ermi added.</p><p>And although according to the rules in the common "Intercity" cars, where many people, such big dogs cannot be gone, for a service dog made an exception. And for all other passengers to be comfortable, Erma was driving in a vestibule.</p><p>“I want to say that the National Guard has cars and cars that are provided for dog transportation. My "colleagues" most often go. And also thank you to Ukrzaliznytsia, who were also worried about this case. My trip is more exception than a trend (I mean - with the transportation of service animals), ”the story added.</p><p>On the eve of social networks there was a photo of Ermi with a movie trainee traveling in a vestibule. The photo posted a passenger who reported that the military with the dog was allegedly not allowed to buy. This message became viral on social networks and caused a stormy discussion and many angry comments.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-559055" height="1180" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-29T14-41-00-08-00/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-29T14-41-00-08-00/000003.jpg" width="957"/><p>Ukrzaliznytsia also responded to the situation, reminding that there are clear rules for the transportation of pets, in particular for Intercity cars in question.
