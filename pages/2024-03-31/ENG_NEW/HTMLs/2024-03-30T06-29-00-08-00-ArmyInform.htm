Now you have been working in the Ministry of Defense for half a year. You can already compare these two experiences. What are your impressions? What was discovered for themselves and what became a real challenge?</strong></p><p>- to compare more correctly not to work in two ministries, but to work experiences to a full -scale invasion and after. In the face of active fighting, time is an objectively very strong parameter. In more peaceful times, there was an additional privilege - to take time for reflection or consultation. Currently, a small delay in the start can be scaled in a wealth of delays on the front line and someone will pay for life. And it is very difficult to abstract from this ethical dilemma.</p><p>At the same time, artificial creation of a sense of urgency or urgency is also a tool for abuse and loosening. The new search for a point where you must do everything right, but at the same time as quickly as possible. It is a kind of search for the balance between correctness and speed. In terms of stress and stress resistance requirements, the Defense Ministry is a serious experience for me ...</p><h2>About NATO Financial Protection Lines</h2><p><strong>- The reform of the financial control and management system is currently underway. What do you think should be changed first and foremost? What are the expectations of innovations?</strong></p><p>- This is one of our flagship reforms, which is now being discussed ... It is done in order to strengthen the systematic financial management and the preventive function of financial control.</p><p>In the first months of work, we have to focus on responding to problems and on fixing their consequences. Today we focus on strengthening the preventive link to prevent early risk detection. Risks that can lead to the loss of human lives, funds, or reputation of a defense department in the future.</p><div class="fotorama--wp" data-auto="false" data-captiontag="dd" data-columns="0" data-icontag="dt" data-ids="559215,559216" data-itemtag="dl" data-link="file" data-max-width="100%" data-ratio="1.5009380863039" data-size="large" data-width="1600"><div class="gallery galleryid-559212 gallery-columns-0 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-1"><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-30T06-29-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-30T06-29-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-30T06-29-00-08-00/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-30T06-29-00-08-00/000002.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl></div></div><p>The Ministry of Defense already has elements of compliance (English-compliance with any internal or external requirements or norms), which are scattered in structural units, there are also certain elements of risk management, which, in particular, is performed by the Main Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. So, we do not start from scratch.</p><p>We are currently thinking about the consolidation of these functions within the individual structural units, so that the mandate and responsibility can be clearly clear. This will identify responsible persons who would report both compliance and identify the most critical risks to the Ministry of Defense. We need to specifically understand how they arise, determine the policy, the rules of the game, so that these risks are minimized and guided.</p><p>In the private corporate sector, this is the so -called second financial protection line. Our NATO partners have a widespread practice. We have the first attempts to introduce it for state institutions.</p><p>To briefly summarize the results of our consultations with colleagues from partner countries, without the second financial protection line, excessive load will lie on the internal audit department that will deal with excess work, catching up with problems, and structural units that have an element of control, but this is the first Our protection line.</p><p>Therefore, everything that "breaks" the first line of protection, respectively, immediately, without encountering the filters of the second line of protection, already reactive becomes the problem of the third line.</p><p>One of the elements of this reform is the creation of a methodological advisory body for the internal audit department (two). This is an audit committee. Currently, the internal agreement is a project to create and approve the personal staff. We see international professional experts in it. Experts who would have proper examination, reputation, range of skills and experience. Our ambition - to make the work of internal audit as a model with their help. Of course, based on joint activity on complete trust, independence and achieving specific results.</p><p>Internal audit, in its essence, should maintain a sufficient level of independence from any intervention, including political. In our legislative field, the internal audit service, as the structure of the Ministry of Defense, is subordinate to the Minister of Defense - with a sufficient level of independence, and the Audit Committee will serve as another preventive from political intervention. We strive to ensure maximum independence two of political intervention.</p><p>In addition, we strive to strengthen and improve the operational work of the internal audit department to make sure that the operational processes are built in accordance with international standards and best practices. In order for the Audit Committee not only to supervise how much the activities of the internal audit department are protected from political intervention, but also methodologically helped to build a system of financial management and control in the Ministry in accordance with the best international practices. And this is not such an exotic experience, it is a general practice for many of our partner countries.</p><div class="fotorama--wp" data-auto="false" data-captiontag="dd" data-columns="0" data-icontag="dt" data-ids="559218,559217" data-itemtag="dl" data-link="file" data-max-width="100%" data-ratio="1.5009380863039" data-size="large" data-width="1600"><div class="gallery galleryid-559212 gallery-columns-0 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-3"><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-30T06-29-00-08-00/000003.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-30T06-29-00-08-00/000003.jpeg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-30T06-29-00-08-00/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-30T06-29-00-08-00/000004.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl></div></div><h2>“Financial Management and Control is our great ambition”</h2><p><strong>- As for the timeframe, when do you plan it?</strong></p><p>- The Audit Committee launches the next weeks. Regarding the functioning of the financial management system, we still have an internal debate as to what the system will look like.</p><p>Financial management and control are our great ambition, which we want to present in the near future. Whether it is holistic, as the construction of all elements, in particular, risk management, Compliment, Audit Committee. We may go less than the reform, starting with the Audit Committee.</p><p>If we cannot create two separate players in the second defense line, we may have somehow consolidate functionality within the existing structural units. Some technical elements of this reform are still discussed.</p><p><strong>- In other countries, how much time was? Western colleagues shared their experience?</strong></p><p>- This is not an innovation that has happened recently. On the other hand, we have made a lot of reforms to a full -scale invasion very quickly.</p><p>And a large -scale invasion further accelerates social changes and transformation. It doesn't matter how much other countries have spent on it, we need to do it quickly, to respond here and now. To go into long dialogues about quite obvious things that showed their effectiveness and efficiency, makes no sense.</p><p>Moreover, we go to NATO ... And this issue will not be removed by Western partners. And it will be difficult to explain what we do not do.</p><p><strong>- If we talk about expectations from this reform, what should happen specifically?</strong></p><p>- We have three main resources that will be engaged in the second defense line (risk management unit, compliance unit. - Ed). "A" is people, "B" is money, "C" is a reputation.</p><p>Therefore, the results will reduce the risks of human, financial and reputational losses.</p><h2>“The budget of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine in 2024 is higher than the initial budget of the Ministry of 2023”</h2><p><strong>- I would like to talk about planning the budget of the Ministry of Defense. Will it be a record budget this year?</strong></p><p>- Budget 2024 has just started. It is too early to speak, because we are at the beginning of the budget period. The budget of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine in 2024 is higher than the initial budget of the Ministry in 2023. However, during 2023, changes were made to the budget of the MOU to respond to the change of the situation and, accordingly, be able to meet the urgent needs of the troops. Such changes are the norm, given the level of uncertainty about the basic budgetary parameters: macroeconomic, support of partners, situation on the battlefield.</p><p>The defense budget is flexible, it is planned conservatively. During the year, the Government, the Verkhovna Rada respond to the changed situation to the factors that have already shown themselves, the parameters that have become known - and corrects. This is normal.</p><p>This year we also started with a conservative plan, realizing that the budget will be adjusted on the march. Therefore, we have no record budget if we compare our starting budget of 2024 with the actual 2023. Let's look at the results of the year and compare.</p><p><strong>- How did the proportions in the budget change during the war? For social payments again the largest share goes?</strong></p><p>- The budget of the Ministry of Defense in 2024 can be divided into three large packages. NATO states are guided by this approach, they categorize their defensive expenditures. Therefore, the first and the largest is cash and combat payments. In 2024 (in accordance with the Law of Ukraine "On the State Budget of Ukraine for 2024". - Ed.) This allocations in the amount of UAH 862.6 billion was allocated, which is more than 70% of the IUU budget. This block includes the financial support of the military, payments to the dead, payments for injuries, for staying at the first and second line of combat, food, material support, remuneration for destroyed equipment. However, it is necessary to take into account the dynamic of the situation on the front and an increase in the needs of the Armed Forces. In the event of an increase in the intensity of hostilities, an increase in the number of troops, there is a need to attract additional financing, which, accordingly, entails changes in the budget and proper government decisions.</p><p>For the second package, it is the purchase of weapons and military equipment. It accounts for more than 20% of our defense budget. That is, 20%is a certain Nativ Benchmark for expenditures on military equipment. Considering the war in Ukraine, some of our neighbors, who also border on the aggressor country, have been spending a fundamentally larger share in recent years. Sumy, in short, demonstration.</p><p>If we talk about funds, we have 265.4 billion hryvnias to close the needs of the military in quality equipment and weapons. I would like to emphasize that these figures are indicative. The needs for the defense sector are dynamic and are constantly refined by the General Staff depending on the combat situation.</p><p>And the third package is operating expenditures. They include fuel purchase, troops, utilities, and ongoing repairs.</p><p>This is all the money provided by the State Budget. However, this year we have additional funds, including those allocated by the government from the reserve fund. Thus, in January, the government allocated the Defense Ministry of Defense UAH 657 million to be sent to military units. These funds are aimed at the purchase of equipment and weapons, optical and thermal imaging devices, communications, ammunition production, repair and maintenance of equipment, etc.</p><p>In addition, there is another innovation of the 2024 budget. It envisages the transfer of a share of tax on the income of individuals (PIT) from local communities to the state budget, with subsequent automatic transfer of funds of "military PIT" to the military units in proportion to their tax. In 2024 it is expected to receive 7.9 billion hryvnias from this source.</p><p>Another source of revenue is local subsidies for defense needs. Regional centers, united territorial communities, districts, cities independently made the decision to allocate funds directly to those military units and to those areas that considered the most priority. Last year, nearly 16 billion hryvnias were transferred. The unused balance of these subsidies in the amount of UAH 4.8 billion has been transferred as an additional resource of military units for 2024.</p><p>It is difficult to build forecasts for changes to the budget for 2024, there are a number of indefinite factors. The defense budget has been laid in the conditions of the greatest armed conflict in Europe since the Second World War. Fierce battles, the needs of defense forces, and the requirements for them change daily. And such variability of scripts logically leads to the revision of the financial indicators of the state budget. Therefore, the need for additional financing may vary depending on the current situation and objective factors.</p><h2>“Connection to NAPC will start much more systematic changes”</h2><p><strong>- There was information about the Ministry of Defense to the portal of NAPCs. What is the situation on this issue today?</strong></p><p>- Connecting to the portal of corruption pronouns - this was Low ganging Fruit (an expression of a fruit that hangs low, which just needs to be taken). The instruments and capabilities were created by the NACC. This tool needs to be used, it will bring your result - and value will be added.</p><p p=""><p>We have created a working group of representatives of key departments of the Ministry, which concentrate the main corruption risks. The working group involves anti -corruption activists, representatives of our anti -corruption council. Accordingly, it is a rather inclusive and open process. This working group began to work at the end of last year, its activities regulated by the NACC.</p><p>Currently, the working group is completing the process of researching the environment of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The survey of the staff of the structural units is conducted and a survey of external parties is being prepared with the defense department. Analysis of offenses, audits and inspections, appeals and complaints, has not been eliminated in the previous period, corruption risks, reports from the media, social networks about possible facts of corruption offenses were investigated.</p><p>The next stage of work will be the identification, analysis, determination of levels of corruption risks, and most importantly, determining measures for their elimination, which will further form the basis of the new anti -corruption program of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. We expect a plan of action for the Ministry, adapted to modern requirements and challenges.</p><p>In addition, we launched an independent external evaluation of internal audit processes. International standards require at least five years. In the Ministry of Defense, such an assessment was carried out in 2017. We have a KPMG contract in Ukraine (a member of the International Network of Independent KPMG companies. It is a part of the Big Four recognized at the international level of companies providing audit, tax and consulting services - ed.). It will carry out an independent assessment of how the Department of Internal Audit of MOU works, its willingness to implement new approaches and procedures during audit research, to improve the professionalism of employees. The KPMG report will help to better understand the current state of internal audit in the department, and in general more effectively control the course of reform. Let's look at their recommendations.</p><p>In addition, from this year we are even more active in the NATO Program for Building Integrity. The purpose of the program is to assist NATO to interested countries in the introduction of effective, virtuous and transparent management in their national defense and security institutions.</p><p>Improving the principles of honesty and effective management is a complex challenge that requires decisive action, strong leadership, taking into account the long -term perspective and the use of effective tools and examples to stimulate changes and accelerate the reform process.</p><p>Therefore, connecting to the portal of corruption of corruption, the result is a good, correct first step to warm up and start much more systematic changes in the Ministry of Defense in terms of financial control and all anticorpolitics. I believe in this maximalistic program.</p><p><strong>- There was information that Ukraine and the United States were jointly monitoring weapons. What is the situation for today?</strong></p><p>- Yes, we have a system of monitoring weapons that we are supplied. The system is built with partners, its first element is self -reporting. At the end of November 2023, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Department of Defense Cooperation of the US Embassy in Ukraine signed the concept of self -reporting. What does it involve? First of all, the Ministry of Defense will supervise compliance with the requirements for self-reporting of the partner country to monitor the final use in the approved procedure. Such supervision includes a joint study with US defense products of a certain category by serial numbers and their proper storage. Certain types of weapons, certain elements of weapons fall under increased monitoring.</p><p>Currently, four joint measures have been carried out in the military units of the Armed Forces, during which certain types of weapons were investigated before being sent directly to the fighting areas. So far, the precedent exists with the United States. There are conversations with other countries that also give us sensitive equipment.</p><p>This is convenient for partner countries, because we answer a number of their procedural challenges, how to do it. But this is also a serious challenge and a certain process of learning. And the cooperation element is important because auditors work with foreign colleagues.</p><p>We see that they monitor, what markers of what they pay attention to, analyzing how well the safety measures are provided, how well the equipment is adequately stored, how it is monitored, use.</p><p>In the event of an internal audit, any deviations from the prescribed order shall be immediately taken appropriate response measures and the Ministry of Defense and foreign partners are notified. We do not hide them. The system is huge, something happens periodically. We are talking about it honestly and reacting.</p><p>We also have a Main Inspectorate toolkit that sets out identified cases and identifies the causes of their occurrence. As of today, the process is ongoing, it has entered the routine plane.</p><p><strong>- Was the idea of monitoring?</strong></p><p>- Yes, we proposed in an initiative order. For us, this is a skill, it is an element of confidence. This is an element of cooperation.</p><p>The Russians are actively working to compromise the confidence in the supply of weapons in the eyes of the public of major countries and suppliers of these weapons. The enemy puts incredible efforts in conducting appropriate information and psychological operations.</p><p>And for us, one of the indirect methods of ensuring our combat capability is the protection of trust itself. That is, to give our partners sufficient confidence that the receipt and use of weapons is carried out in accordance with the principles of integrity, legality of efficiency and effectiveness. The weapons were passed on to the Government of Ukraine, it controls it and uses it for its intended purpose.</p><p>So, it will be irresponsible to watch the efforts of Russians who are actively in compromising this trust. It is necessary to make additional efforts in order to demonstrate this openness, the obligations to openness, the facts of the openness, and to give both the media, politicians, and the society of those countries that give us this weapon, the most unbiased, verified evidence that those The accusation is a fake.</p><p><strong>- Thank you for the conversation!</strong></p></p></div>
