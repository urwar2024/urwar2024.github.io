The most common is the equipment of conventional freely falling FAB-2550, Fab-500 unified planning and correction module (UMPC).</p><p>It used to be an artificial product, now the Russians produce them commercially. According to some reports, several thousand such modules have been released today. The UMPC is a light fuselage that contains a control antenna, a GPS module plus an inertial laser course system and an altimeter.</p><p>The wings and the navigation system allow the modified bomb to plan at a distance of 60-80 km depending on the height of the launch and speed of the aircraft. As a rule, they are launched from a height of 6-7 km, then you can hit a whole at a distance of 60-70 km. If the aircraft rises higher, it is easier to see our air defense.</p><p>One of the main carriers of these bombs is the Su-34-the Russian front bomber.</p><p>Thanks to the Kabam, the Russians invented a new tactic against which our troops are difficult to resist. The bomb of 500, 1000, 1500 kg of explosives destroys any fortifications.</p><p>In addition, all fighters who are within a radius of approximately 100 m from the place of arrival of the bomb and who did not even get injured from the debris, suffer contusion, barotraum and lose their combat capacity for some time.</p><p>The relatively low accuracy of these weapons is overly offset by a powerful combat part. The design of the UMPC is simple to primitive. For example, before the discharge of the bomb is powered by electricity from the carrier, the mechanism of disconnection of the power supply is absent, so when the wire is discharged the power is simply broken.</p><p>This simplicity determines the manufacturability and relatively low cost of KAB, which made it possible to quickly establish their serial production. This makes it possible to carry out dozens of drops per day in limited areas of the front. Since the beginning of 2024, Russian aviation has used more than three thousand such bombs.</p><p>How can KABs be counteracted? The main means of counteraction is the destruction of the aircraft carrying these bombs — the Su-34. A certain number of such aircraft have already been destroyed. But there are other developments.</p><p>There are a large number of technical solutions in the world that allow you to effectively combat airlines that are adjusted, in particular. Let's look at some of them.</p><p>First, the cabins can be knocked down by air-air-air rockets, SPR missiles and MSr. But for effective lesions requires a target, that is, it is necessary to know when, where and where the bomb flies, and it should be borne in mind that the cost of any of these missiles is much higher than the cost of the bomb. This makes their use not too profitable.</p><p>Therefore, NATO countries are trying to solve this problem through the use of rapid-fire automatic artillery systems.</p><p>The first to use artisystems for such tasks began on the fleet: first to combat attacking missiles, and later with bombs that are adjusted.</p><p>Having tied up existing radiation anti -aircraft artillery installation, sailors received a fairly effective means of self -defense. Since the need for systems of land in landers is no less than the navy crews, they invented the fastest and easiest option - to put an existing naval system on a large truck.</p><p>In this way, the navy Vulcan-Phalanx ciws (stands for Close-in Weapon System-a system of weapons of melee.-Avt.) Turned into Phalanx Centurion b c-Ram (Counter Rocket, Artilry, and Mortar).</p><div class="fotorama--wp" data-auto="false" data-captiontag="dd" data-columns="0" data-icontag="dt" data-ids="559258,559257" data-itemtag="dl" data-link="file" data-max-width="100%" data-ratio="2.0177339901478" data-size="large" data-width="2048"><div class="gallery galleryid-559256 gallery-columns-0 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-1"><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" aria-describedby="gallery-1-559258" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-30T08-41-00-08-00/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-30T08-41-00-08-00/000001.jpg" width="150"/></dt><dd class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-1-559258">Centurion C-RAM, Photo from open sources</dd></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" aria-describedby="gallery-1-559257" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-30T08-41-00-08-00/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-30T08-41-00-08-00/000002.jpg" width="150"/></dt><dd class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-1-559257">Centurion C-RAM, Photo from open sources</dd></dl></div></div><p>On the four-axle chassis Hemt A3 is a Turel with a 20mm M61 six-barrel gun, a radar of a centimeter range, as well as an optical and heat-thermal module. Finding goals, aiming and even opening fire are automated.</p><p>Centurion will scan the set sector in the offline mode, detect goals and open fire. Alternatively, the decision to defeat the goal can be made by the operator. The speed of the complex - 4500 shots per minute, ie 75 shots per second.</p><p>Centurion can even knock down hypersonic missiles on the last air defense border. The complex showed itself quite effective in Iraq, where even mortar mines were knocked down in the defense of the bases and litters. The disadvantages of this complex are its considerable mass, high size and cost of BC.</p><p>The Germans have come up much more thoroughly. The Oerlikon Skyshildd family (German designation Mantis-Modular, Automatic and Network Capable Targeting and Interception System) is a system that includes 6-8 remotely managed automated combat modules, 2 RLS. ) .</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-559259" height="800" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-30T08-41-00-08-00/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-30T08-41-00-08-00/000003.jpg" width="1600"/><p>The combat module is mounted on the ISO 1D container platform, which allows it to be placed on a container platform with the possibility of unloading on soil and self -loading, as well as on a number of chassis, starting with the MAN truck to the BTR Boxer.</p><p>Weapons of the combat module are 35 mm automatic Oerlicon KDA or KDG 35/1000 (half of GDF-020) double power with multi-mode "smart" ABM (Air Burst Munition) airline.</p><p>The PMD062 AHEAD projectile is programmed via an electromagnetic inductor located on the barrel. Each 35-mm projectile is approximately equal to 5-6 pieces of 20-mm shells in terms of metal weight, and the rate of fire of 550 rounds per minute gives a decent cloud of fragments in the target area.</p><p>The control of the system is automated, it is integrated into almost any air defense complex with any radars of sufficient characteristics.</p><p>Sky Guard, Skyranger, Skynex, which have a similar design and can be applied to close defense against high -precision weapons (VTZ) are further development.</p><p>As military analyst Serhiy Berezutsky told ArmyInform, "as we can see, KABs are not an absolute weapon, there are samples of systems that are able to effectively fight them, the point is how quickly we will see them at the front and in the defense of our cities. I hope that in the near future they will appear at the front and in the air defense systems of cities. We need to continue to work on saturating air defense with these systems, because the enemy's use of KABs will only increase, and there are still not enough means of effective combat against carriers in Ukraine."</p><p>The air force reported that the air defense system should be echelorated, and each echelon is responsible for certain distances and heights. The aforementioned systems are aircraft of land troops designed to work for small distances. It would be nice to have enough modern systems, but so far in the fight against cabin we expect to strengthen the anti-aircraft missile systems of a large radius that can counteract the carriers of cabins and keep Russian aircraft at a long distance, and also expect modern F- modern aircraft. 16.</p></div>
