In order to avoid punishment for these crimes, in the summer of 2023 a woman escaped to the Zhytomyr region.</p><p>Hiding in a rented house, she actively communicated in the chats of Russian Telegram channels, where she tried to find earnings.</p><p>Therefore, the malefactor got into the field of view of the Russian special service. Subsequently, she was remotely recruited by the FSB personnel employee.</p><p>On his instructions, the agent resumed her communication with former villagers in Donetsk region in order to "secretly" receive the "necessary" information from them.</p><p>It was found that a traitor in the guise of household conversations on the phone tried to find out about the facts of the Ukrainian air defense during the racist air attacks.</p><p>In the case of "confirmation", she further asked about the approximate base of firing positions of the anti-aircraft missile complexes of the Armed Forces.</p><p>Intelligence information was needed by occupiers to "bypass" Ukrainian air defense on the Eastern Front.</p><p>However, the Security Service thwarted the enemy's plans. Having exposed the russian agent in advance, the SSU documented her criminal actions and took measures to secure air defence.</p><p>At the final stage of the special operation, the defendant was detained in temporary premises. During the search, she found a mobile phone, which she used in intelligence and subversive activities.</p><p>The SSU investigators have notified the detainee of suspicion under Part 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (high treason committed under martial law).</p><p>The malefactor is in custody. She is threatened with life imprisonment.</p><p>As<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/18/zatrymaly-batka-ta-syna-z-brovariv-yaki-korektuvaly-raketni-obstrily-i-zbyraly-reshtky-rosiyan/">reported the armyinform</a>, detained a father and son from Brovary, who were adjusting rocket attacks and collecting the remains of the Russians.</p><div class="single-header"></div></div>
