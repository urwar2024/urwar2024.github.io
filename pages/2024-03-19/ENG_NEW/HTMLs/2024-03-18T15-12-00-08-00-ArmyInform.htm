The Government of Japan considers it an ambitious but possible task. It is important to combine all possible efforts and attract all the inner stakeholders, ”Yamashita said.</p><p>The first secretary also shared the Japanese demining experience.</p><p>- It has been 80 years since we fought with the Americans. However, we are still trying to exchanging some territories, and we understand that it needs patience. We have been working with the Kambodzhinsky Demin Center for 25 years. Many methodologies have been developed, and we will share them with Ukraine so that you can bring your people back to safe territories, - said Yamashita Nozom.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-552662" height="998" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-18T15-12-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-18T15-12-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" width="1500"/><p>The Embassy of Japan also voiced three main approaches to cooperation with Ukraine in the field of humanitarian demining</p><p>- The first approach is the provision of equipment and vehicles. The second is the training programs for building capabilities for the SES. Finally, the third is the localization of the production of equipment and vehicles to create a humanitarian mine market, - the first secretary said.</p><p>According to Yamashita Nozom, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency has already provided 30 manipulatory tractors to Ukraine. In addition, Japan has transferred dozens of wagons and pickups to Ukraine to determine the location of explosive objects.</p><p>- Currently, 22 humanitarian agencies are being manufactured in Japan, and the first batch of such heavy machines will arrive in Ukraine in June this year. We will also create a partnership with local organizations to repair such machines and provide them with support, - Yamashita Nozoma said.</p><p>The first secretary assured that Japan would support Ukraine and the entire Ukrainian demining sector to victory over a cynical enemy.</p><p>“Japan will support the entire Ukrainian demining sector, and will stand with Ukraine until the last mine in Ukraine is neutralized,” Yamashita Nozoma assured.</p><p>Japan also strongly condemned the cynical attack of the Russians on Odessa, which took place on March 15.</p><p>- In addition to gratitude to all Ukrainian sappers who liberate Ukrainian land from the consequences of unprovoked Russian aggression, I would like to speak about the terrible attack that took place in Odessa on March 15. The Embassy of Japan expresses its sincere condolences to the families of the victims, - said the first secretary.</p><p><em>Photo by the author</em></p></div>
