It is a real unique unit and top soldiers, capable of performing any complex operational-combat task, ”-said SBU chairman Vasyl Malyuk.</p><p>The unit is the volunteers-patriots, who, with the beginning of a large-scale invasion, have entered the CSU "A" of the SBU. And since then they participated in operations on the defense of the Kyiv region, the liberation of the territories of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya, Donetsk regions and Kherson.</p><p>"In addition to hostile equipment, the White Wolf also destroyed about 300 objects, such as fortifications, warehouses, fire positions," - said the head of the CSU "A" of the SBU, Eugene Cloud.</p><p>According to Oleg Yemets, the commander of the White Wolf unit in the film, more than 50 Russian tanks were burned in Kharkiv region. This weakened the enemy's defense and allowed the Armed Forces with minimal losses and release the territory very quickly.</p><p>According to Oleg Yemets, the White Wolf specializes in working with drones, one of the first to combine their intelligence and shock functions. Since then, the unit has been focused on the training and development of military professions such as pilots, navigators, navigriers and sappers.</p><p>"They are engaged in the fact that they cause successful fire damage with the help of shock copters, that is, they throw off the ammunition," Vasily Miduk explains.</p><p>In the movie, the White Wolf fighters told many examples of combat work, including how one crew struck 13 units of hostile equipment overnight. They also shared emotions about the loss of Alexander Engel's brothers (the boatman call sign) in Kharkiv and the personal motivation to fight for victory.</p><p>The movie "SBU: Special Forces of Victory" was created by the company "Ukrainian Production Hub" (UPHub) with the assistance of the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine.
