It remains significant even against the backdrop of the absolutely astronomical funds that now operates the Security and Defense of Ukraine, given the shock state of fighting. These funds served as a kind of financial buffer for military units, allowing you to respond quickly and close certain current needs, \u201dYuri Jigir commented.</p><p class=\"\">The funds allocated by communities purchased a wide range of goods: equipment and weapons, optical and thermal imaging devices, communications.

The government has made management decisions to allocate additional funds so that the military units would pass the first months before the Redistribution of the PIT. We now hope that there will be several tools, and subsidies in 2024 will also come and use the proper nomenclature, \u201dYuri Dzhigir added.</p><p class=\"\"><div class=\"mIOAIO_blockquote\"><blockquote class=\"_miaomo90\"><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Reference:</strong></span>Decentralization on Communications-A Joint Initiative of the USAID Decentralization Program Better Results and Effectiveness, the Ukrainian Crisis Media Center, the All-Ukrainian Association of United Territorial Communities and the Portal \"Decentralization\".</p></blockquote></div></p></div>", "source": "https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/18/vydileni-gromadamy-ponad-16-mlrd-grn-na-potreby-zsu-vykorystovuvatymutsya-prozoro-i-efektyvno-yurij-dzhygyr/", "title": "The communities allocated over UAH 16 billion in the Armed Forces will be used transparently and effectively - Yuri Jigir", "description": "This was emphasized by Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Yuri Dzhigir during ...", "author": ["Army Inform"], "categories": ["\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438"], "tags": ["\u0414\u0435\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044f \u043d\u0430\u00a0\u0437\u0432\u2019\u044f\u0437\u043a\u0443", "\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0456 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438", "\u042e\u0440\u0456\u0439 \u0414\u0436\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0440"], "source_name": "ArmyInform"}
