There is no demobilization during the war in ordinary legislation. No one was counting on it. Therefore, there are different questions: about rotation, vacations, ”said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p><p>Asked if Ukraine plans to carry out large -scale mobilization, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: "Mobilization in Ukraine has been from the very beginning of the war and it continues every few months."</p><p>“The mobilization has been from the beginning of the war and continues every few months. It is a prolongation of the appropriate decision in parliament. Is it perfect? Of course not. When you are in a state of war, you come to more practical details. And these changes are being considered in parliament, ”the President added.</p><p>He also stressed that there is a lot of misinformation around mobilization issues.</p></div>
