It is the embodiment of women's Ukrainian power and power. Today, this figure of Ukrainian folklore symbolizes the anger and image of Ukrainian women who resistance to Russia's invasion of their country, oppose war crimes that the Russian army does daily.</strong></p><p>That is why the female Ukrainian nonviolent resistance movement, which arose in the occupied Melitopol in early 2023, was named<a href="https://zlamavka.com/zhinochyj-partyzanskyj-ruh-zla-mavka/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">“Evil mawka”</a>. Then, at the beginning of a large -scale invasion, three brave women decided to unite and resist the Russian occupation regime. Now this movement has united around hundreds of women who were in a forced occupation. Activists, at risk of life, distribute posters, postcards and other materials every day.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-550149" height="447" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-12T11-00-00-08-00/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-12T11-00-00-08-00/000001.jpg" width="794"/><h2 style="text-align: center;">“I don't want flowers! I want my Ukraine! ”</h2><p>On the eve of March 8, the occupiers decided to congratulate women on the holiday and gave off tulips and humanitarian aid on the streets.</p><p>"Evil Mavka" "generously thanked" the Russians for the gifts and put in public places in the temporarily occupied territories, postcards with the inscription "I do not want flowers! I want my Ukraine! ”</p><p>“The invaders began to distribute flowers to our women, but on March 8 is not a holiday of tulips. This is International Day of Women who are fighting for their rights! ” - reported in the evil Mavka.</p><p>Immediately after a women's day, a surprise was waiting for the occupiers in Melitopol.</p><p>One of the traffic activists is engaged in drawing. She created the first poster "The invaders got, not to break up Ukrainian", which women began to hang immediately in crowded places. The reaction was fast: the Russians merged and the posters were immediately ripped.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-550151" height="600" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-12T11-00-00-08-00/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-12T11-00-00-08-00/000002.jpg" width="500"/><p>“It was not possible to hang them at the administrative building: the center of Melitopol was almost closed, there are patrols everywhere, many soldiers. Therefore, we hang where we could, "said Evil Mavka.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">"Kitchen Mavka"</h2><p>As they say, the woman is the shore and mistress. Some men even believe that a woman's place is only in the kitchen.</p><p>Well, "evil Mavka" is endlessly advice, because such philosophy gave activists a safe opportunity to feed the occupiers.</p><p>"The laxative was an ideal option: it would be the occupants, they would be obis ... Unfortunately, and perhaps, fortunately, we did not see the results, but we were told that everything was as necessary, ”the activists said.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-550152" height="788" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-12T11-00-00-08-00/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-12T11-00-00-08-00/000003.jpg" width="1400"/><p>In addition, for a while, Melitopol has declared a dry law, and the invaders are very fond of drinking.</p><p>According to the activists, there were even cases when the Russian military went to homes, "they were" expelled ", because they were extremely necessary. So, "evil maws" decided to make homemade alcohol.</p><p>“Oh, it was indeed a lousy ray! And not a bottle, not two, but a lot. It was difficult to accurately calculate the dosage, somewhere, maybe overdo it. I can only imagine how the Russians were "serving" in such a state. Many wanted to put poison. But, firstly, it is not very easy for us to find (though something could come up with something), and secondly, to sprinkle the poison whether or not is a difficult ethical question, ”women said.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">“Money Money”</h2><p>In addition to the dose of art, delicious pies and strong vodka, "Mavka" is also engaged in the creation of a new design of Russian rubles.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-550153" height="1280" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-12T11-00-00-08-00/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-12T11-00-00-08-00/000004.jpg" width="960"/><p>The "updated" design of Russian rubles has already been "launched" in Melitopol, Berdyansk, Tokmak, Kakhovka, Simferopol, Sevastopol and Yalta.</p><p>And in the occupied territories the activist is always near the enemy, they see and hear everything. "Mavka" knows everything about the enemy: where they settle, what they are carrying, in which ham they walk and when, know everything that can be useful, to help "Kitchen Mavka" and for the Guys of the Armed Forces.</p><p>A special "love" "Mavka" is manifested in the Russian tricolor.</p><p>Yes, on the telegram-channel of activists often there are videos with the burning of the Rashist unnecessary.</p><p>“There is nothing more frozen than Russian tricolor on our streets! Come on with us to tear, burn, paint all Russian, ”the activists urge.</p><p>Shortly after the temporarily occupied territories will take place the elections of the President of the Russian Federation, where, according to the invaders, more than 30 percent of Ukrainians will vote.</p><p>Well ... "Evil Mavka" is ready for a new serving of rage and protests. To be continued!</p></div>
