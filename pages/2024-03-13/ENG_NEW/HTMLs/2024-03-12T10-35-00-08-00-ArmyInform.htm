Later, quieter submarines appeared, so they began to be caught by echolocation.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-550403" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_550403" style="width: 1079px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-550403" height="718" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-12T10-35-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-12T10-35-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" width="1079"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-550403">CAPTAS-4 hydraulic devices in the manufacturer shop.

Once in a given position, the equipment begins to produce sound waves that are reflected from the objects and determine their location, and then the data is transferred to the command-commanding point, ”the expert said.</p><p>Mark Bok highlighted two main advantages of the system - the great action radius and distribution of signals. Since the CAPTAS-4 "noise" in the water, the submarine can hear and dump it and then attack it. However, the signal of the enemy's location will not receive a drone, but other accompanying echo of the vessel, which will not be known to be hostile submarine.</p><p>“This is a very scary scenario for the submarines. And the United States should be proud of that they will have such an advantage in defense, ”the Thales representative summarized.</p><p>According to Mark Bok, the CAPTAS-4 contract will be adapted for use on US military frigates of the Constel (FFG-62).</p><p>“If there is at least one area in which French defensive know-how has received a general recognition, then it is a Protetic War. Whether these are frigates, submarines, or marine patrols, the French fleet very often demonstrated advanced technical capabilities in profile combat work, even exceeding such very effective allies - America and the United Kingdom. Thus, in recent years, new French frigates of the Aquitania class have repeatedly won the Hook'EM contest, organized by the US Navy, which identifies the best NATO crews in the field of anti -water fighting underwater, ” - not without boasting<a href="https://meta-defense.fr/ru/2022/04/01/lus_navy_%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B5%D1%82_%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80_thales_captas_4_%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F_%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B8%D1%85_%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Described</a>CAPTAS-4 device French portal Meta-Defense.fr.</p><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7XZ4e7VnB48?feature=oembed" title="Anti-submarine device searches various depths" width="640"></iframe></p><p>CAPTAS-4 hydraulic device.
