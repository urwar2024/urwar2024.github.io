In this case, fossil fuel based on hydrocarbons has a much higher energy density, but it is quite expensive.</p><p>Darpa researchers are looking for an opportunity to generate fuel from carbon dioxide sources, as they say, in places to provide high energy density and simplify logistics. According to them, the capture, storage and conversion of carbon dioxide into energy -accumulating fuel will create a completely closed system that can replenish its stocks on its own.</p><p>Such an action scheme could simplify recharging and operating batteries during military missions.</p><figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-552258\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_552258\" style=\"width: 1293px\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-552258\" height=\"728\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1293px) 100vw, 1293px\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-17T13-09-00-08-00/000002.jpg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-17T13-09-00-08-00/000002.jpg\" width=\"1293\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-552258\">Recharging batteries on the battlefield.
