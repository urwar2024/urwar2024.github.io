Today, he is a prosthetical hand from scratch in the kitchen, which collects drones that destroy Russian equipment and save the lives of Ukrainian defenders and defenders.</strong></p><p>The history of the military<a href="https://t.me/zedigital/4363" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">told</a>Minister of digital transformation Mikhail Fedorov.</p><p>Until February 2022, Nicholas worked as an electrician and in his spare time repaired the returns and lamps.</p><p>From February 24, 2022, his life, like all Ukrainians, has changed. The man was mobilized in a landing team. Nicholas fought in the Donetsk direction, first corrected artillery, then became a gunner.</p><p>In January 2023, Nicholas was seriously injured. The right hand could not be saved ...</p><p>For a long time he is treated in the United States. It was there that Nicholas and installed a smart bionic prosthesis ESPER HAND, which, incidentally, was made in Ukraine. Such a prosthesis learns and improves managing over time.</p><p>So Nicholas again took the hobby - soldering. However, now the man does not engage in returns, but FPV-Drons.</p><p>The prosthetical hand from scratch in the kitchen Nicholas collects drones that destroy Russian equipment and keep the lives of our defenders and defenders.</p><p>So "drones in the kitchen" have already become a new element of our DNA. The new technological culture of the nation is being formed right now. The main thing is that everyone is taught at their maximum in their place, supporting the defense forces. Because even one soldering iron helps to keep the system, ”said the Minister of Digital Transformation Mikhail Fedorov.</p></div>
