Of course, a limited number of ships, in the sense of their size. There is a connection with the Azov-Black Sea region in the Russian Federation. It is also the Volga-Don Channel from Caspia, where there are also ships, where the inner waters of the Russian Federation of the so-called, which allow from Kazan to lower the ships in the Azov, which in Zelenoidolsk, for example, are being built-small missile ships, \u201dDmytro Pletenchuk said.</p><p>However, he pointed to the absurdity of building new Russian ships.</p><p>\u201cThere is a different question here.

And that they can not, of course, afford to get out of the Black Sea waters. Because they have the coasts there in the Black and Azov Sea.
