Of course, a limited number of ships, in the sense of their size. There is a connection with the Azov-Black Sea region in the Russian Federation. It is also the Volga-Don Channel from Caspia, where there are also ships, where the inner waters of the Russian Federation of the so-called, which allow from Kazan to lower the ships in the Azov, which in Zelenoidolsk, for example, are being built-small missile ships, ”Dmytro Pletenchuk said.</p><p>However, he pointed to the absurdity of building new Russian ships.</p><p>“There is a different question here. Is this meaning? Because they are now limited in the use of even available ships, available units. What is the point of adding more targets to Ukraine's defense forces in the Black Sea? ” - asked the spokesman of the Navy of the Armed Forces.</p><p>He also noted that if Russia had removed its ships from the Black Sea, it would have already been capitulation.</p><p>“As for the passage through the Turkish ducts, which are also called Bosphorus and Dardanelles, according to Montrere, they cannot go, as we are. They cannot go out theoretically, but still to the decision of the Turkish Republic, which is actually the owner of these ducts. Not even this is a problem. And that they can not, of course, afford to get out of the Black Sea waters. Because they have the coasts there in the Black and Azov Sea. And they cannot afford to not fulfill their own territorial waters, because it will be a frank surrender, ”Dmitry Pletenchuk said.</p><p>As reported<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/11/u-vms-zsu-vkazaly-na-unikalnu-pauzu-z-vyvedennyam-vorogom-korabliv-u-chorne-more/">Armyinform</a>, the Navy of the Armed Forces indicated a unique pause with the enemy of ships into the Black Sea.</p></div>
