Stockholm International Institute for Peace Problems Research (<a href="https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2024/european-arms-imports-nearly-double-us-and-french-exports-rise-and-russian-exports-fall-sharply" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sipri</a>) in his annual report compared the last period of 2019-2023 from 2014-2018 and revealed a number of dramatic changes, according to the Armyinform.</p><p>Although the global volume of international weapons deliveries over the last five years has decreased slightly - by 3.3% - European countries have almost doubled the import of major weapons (+94%). Much larger weapons came to Asia and Oceania, as well as the Middle East, where nine of ten major importers are located.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-550239" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_550239" style="width: 1280px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-550239" height="773" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T16-53-99/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T16-53-99/000001.jpg" width="1280"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-550239">Source: Stockholm International Institute database<br/>Research of Peace Problems (SIPRI).

As before, the first position is confidently held by the United States, whose exports have increased by 17%over the last five years. This, in particular, led to an increase from 34% to 42% of their share in the total volume of world weapons exports.</p><p>In 2019-2023, the United States supplied the main weapons in 107 states, which is more than all previous P &amp; amp;#39; Yatty-year periods, and much more than any other weapon exporter.</p><p>"At a time when the economic and geopolitical domination of the United States is challenging, America has strengthened its global role in a weapon supplier-an important aspect of its foreign policy-exporting more weapons to more countries than ever in the past,"-said Matthew George, SIPRI Weapons Director.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-550240" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_550240" style="width: 1280px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-550240" height="773" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T16-53-99/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T16-53-99/000002.jpg" width="1280"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-550240">Source: Stockholm International Institute database<br/>Research of Peace Problems (SIPRI). March 2024. Infographic<br/>Armyinform</figcaption></figure><p>It is important, according to analysts, that it is in the United States that accounts for about 55% of imports of weapons imported by European countries in 2019-2023, which is 20% more than in the previous P &amp; amp;#39; The decisions of NATO European countries to import weapons from the United States are determined by many factors - technological, military, financial - and, in particular, necessity<br/>Maintain transatlantic relations, the document is said.</p><p>"If transatlantic relations are changing in the coming years, the policy of European states in the field of arms procurement may also change," Sipri Dan Smith said.</p><p style="text-align: left;">In the second place among the exporters, in the squeezing of Russia, France came, whose exports of weapons increased by 47%, and the share in worldwide deliveries increased to 11%(in 2014-2018 - 7.2%). The growth of French weapons exports occurred mainly as a result of the supply of combat aircraft to India, Qatar and Egypt. The largest importer of French weapons was India, which accounted for almost 30% of military deliveries from France.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Russian exports have fallen almost twice</h2><p>Russia has moved to the third place in the ranking of world suppliers of weapons. In 2019-2023, exports of weapons from the Russian Federation decreased almost twice - by 53%. In the global supply, the share of Russia decreased by 10% and equalized with French.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-550241" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_550241" style="width: 1106px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-550241" height="608" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T16-53-99/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T16-53-99/000003.jpg" width="1106"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-550241">Russian SCK C-400 and "shell-C1" by 2022 actively bought<br/>in foreign markets.

Another sign of reducing the role of Russia as a global weapons supplier is that if in 2019 Moscow supplied weapons to 31 states, then in 2022 only 14, and in 2023 - at 12.</p><p>In 2019-2023, a little less than two -thirds of Russian exports of arms occurred in three countries: India (34%), China (21%) and Egypt (7.5%). India in the past five years was the largest recipient of Russian weapons, but how to compare from 2014–2018, exports to India decreased by 34%, China - by 39%, and in Egypt - by 54%. Experts believe that in the short term, Russian arms exports are likely to remain much lower than the level reached in 2014-2018.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Germany closes the first five</h2><p>Germany retained the fifth place in the ranking of major weapons exporters. Over the considered period, its exports decreased by 14%, and the share of the country in world deliveries decreased slightly - 5.6%against 6.3%. At the same time, Berlin, together with Paris, is in the top three weapons suppliers to European countries. The share of Germany and France was 6.4% and 4.6% respectively.</p><p>2023 was especially successful for the German defense industry.</p><p>"Of course, this is due to the military assistance of Ukraine, but also, for example, the supply of submarines to Singapore, frigates and corvettes to Israel and Egypt," said Senior Sipri Sipri Veseman.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-550242" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_550242" style="width: 996px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-550242" height="531" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T16-53-99/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T16-53-99/000004.jpg" width="996"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-550242">German tanks Leopard 2.

At the same time, the total growth of military imports against 2014–2018 was a record 6633%. The main suppliers of weapons of Kiev were the United States (39%), Germany and Poland, respectively 14%and 13%.</p><p>According to the conclusions of Swedish analysts, the large -scale aggressive war of Russia against Ukraine, part of which became massive air strikes on infrastructure objects, influenced not only the growth of weapons import for Kiev, but also the structure of orders. The reaction of Western and Central Europe that fears the expansion of Russian aggression has become<br/>Increase in imports of air defense systems.</p><p>For example, in 2023, Poland ordered 48 Patriot launchers, 644 missiles to them, as well as various sensors, auxiliary equipment and spare parts. The total amount of the agreement was estimated at $ 15 billion (€ 13.7 billion).</p><p>At the same time, Germany intends to pay Israel nearly four billion euros for the latest ARRW 3 missile defense system, capable of hitting targets at an altitude of more than 100 kilometers. And German air defense systems will be placed in Austria, Estonia, Latvia and Slovenia.</p><p>"In the last two years, we have been seeing a significantly increased demand for air defense systems in Europe, which has pushed Russia's missile campaign against Ukraine," said Senior Sipri Sipri Sipri Veseman.</p></div>
