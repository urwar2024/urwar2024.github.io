On the stairs to the journalistic hub, based on a crutch, the chunky rises - under 2 meters, a man.</strong></p><p>The brothers call Timur Ball - not only because of height. During his stay on the front, this rich man repeatedly showed considerable agility in the organization of the work of a medical center, and the wise word supported the wounded comrades.</p><p>For the sake of them, the man sacrificed his health - today every step is given to him with difficulty: a untimely referral to doctors about knee injury has led to irreversible changes in the body ...</p><p>Before the Great War, Timur lived in the life of an average Ukrainian citizen: he raised two sons, had his own business - a computer equipment repair service. Since 2014 he has been engaged in volunteering for the Eastern Front.</p><img alt="" class="verticalimg alignnone wp-image-549928 size-full" height="1280" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T06-53-99/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T06-53-99/000001.jpeg" width="960"/><p>On February 24, 2022, it began for a man from the sounds of artillery explosions - Ball lives in Saltovka, Kharkiv residential district, closest to borders with Russia.</p><p>- From those sounds I literally slipped out of bed. He called his wife - she is a doctor, works at the trauma center. She said that the first wounded came - that is, what we expected, but did not believe the last, - Timur recalls.</p><p>For the first few days, the man tried to "exist" in his neighborhood: he equipped the basement for shelter, searched for food and the ability to charge the Pelbank, then distributed them to neighbors and people who were just afraid to leave the bomb shelters or premises.</p><p>And Timur's wife was at work around the clock: the number of victims of Russian shellings grew, some of her colleagues refused to replace or just could not get.</p><p>The woman did not see the point of overcoming the path of almost 10 kilometers on foot, enduring her life. Subsequently, one of the sons of the couple joined her - he settled in a trauma center.</p><p>And Timur began to look for the opportunity to join the ranks of the Ukrainian army: he was corty to take his arms to kill those who came with the war in Slobozhanshchina.</p><p>-Somehow in one of the telegrams, I read the announcement that a new team of terroboron is being formed. Called for the specified number, arrived, took shape. It was March 9, 2022, - recalls the Army.</p><p>Due to the fact that the battalion of territorial defense, where the man was distributed, just formed, and in the first days, until the security was established except weapons, the personnel had nothing. Volunteers came to the rescue:</p><p>- They gave us the first "aid kits": a kind of file in which a bandage, a syringe, analgin ampoule, a few pills and a harness. When it turned out that others were understood even less than I was, I was sent to give them to people and explain what to do with this good, - the man smiles.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549929" height="1280" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T06-53-99/000002.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T06-53-99/000002.jpeg" width="960"/><p>After this case, Ball was appointed to the post of sanitary, and subsequently sent for tactical medicine courses. Already, it turned out to be courses for military with medical education ...</p><p>During the week, the man mastered medical science, as they say, without raising his head. Graduation exams "Ball" passed perfectly ...</p><p>She shares that he has promoted success in teaching the experience of providing domedic assistance in hiking, which remained in the distant former life. In addition, his mother was also a physician - since childhood, Timur was very inquisitive and read a lot of profile literature.</p><p>The first "300th" in the career of the Balla Ballah was when the invaders were kissed at the point of permanent dislocation of the unit:</p><p>- That night I had to check the posts. I already went out, but at the last moment I came back to take something forgotten. And here I go a few steps away from the door, and at this moment he rejects me with a shock wave!</p><p>Most likely, the man got a contusion - for a while he came to his senses and tried to understand where he and what was going around.</p><p>The Terromorobronets from the screams - the wounds got him his brothers. Already in the basement of Timur and two more doctors provided a friend.</p><p>Ball recalls that the life of the affected guy was rescued by an occlusion lining, which was presented to him during the certificate of certificates for medical courses.</p><p>Medical brothers, Timur, struck the spirit: no panic, only a cold mind while assisting and a clear consistency in actions ... Although, he notes, he worried about himself that he would forget something, something would go wrong.</p><p>After the successful counter -offensive of the Ukrainian security and defense forces in Kharkiv region, the battalion, where the Ball Service was served, was ordered to move to the Donetsk region.</p><p>- One day the commander calls me with the words: collect things, I gave you to the beginning. I went to Bakhmut, where fierce fighting continued, where doctors were not catastrophically lacking, - the man recalls.</p><p>Already in the place-fortress Terrobronets, together with the new chief, equipped a stabilization point. He says that the Stabik was located in the basement.</p><p>They helped the arrangement of the brothers - they searched for some cabinets, clams, doors, mattresses.</p><p>This is how the Bakhmut Adventures of Balla began.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549930" height="867" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1156px) 100vw, 1156px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T06-53-99/000003.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T06-53-99/000003.jpeg" width="1156"/><p>The man tells that thanks to excellent preparation with such, the Spaniard Combat paid special attention to this - the wounded was brought already dressed, with properly imposed turnstiles.</p><p>They only need to download them to a car and send them to a medical institution in Druzhkivka.</p><p>-The wounds were mostly mine-explosive. One of the most difficult was the extreme "300th": he had a fracture of his legs, a wound in the groin, plus he was very cut with his face and eyes-it was unclear whether he would see at all.</p><p>The situation was complicated by the fact that the fighter could not endure pain at all and in every way prevented him from providing help.</p><p>- We worked with him almost in the morning, reached the serious painkillers, because the other simply did not take it. He was constantly spinning, shouting, which was why the bleeding only increased. They exhaled when they were evacuated, - says "Ball".</p><p>But, the man remembers, among the wounded there were also those who impressed with their willpower:</p><p>- They brought our scout, who had no knee physically - he was simply pulled out by an explosion. He was all cut, heavily injured his hand, but the person abandoned the painkillers. He endured, joked while treating his wounds - apparently such a character ...</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549931" height="1156" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T06-53-99/000004.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-11T06-53-99/000004.jpeg" width="867"/><p>There were also atypical cases in Timur's practice where they had to provide medical care because of injuries.</p><p>- The brothers delivered the wounded on the wooden door. Apparently, then adrenaline played in the blood of the carriers, because I then tried to lift the door-they were not attorney, and the boys either carried or pulled them a kilometers one and a half or two.</p><p>One of the military already in the "stabbing" from the load was bad and he fainted - he took his heart. I had to reanimate urgently.</p><p>One day, when the next wounded to the pickup, the ball felt a sharp knee pain. He almost could not step on his foot - it was necessary to consult a specialist and find out the cause, but the man realized that he needed here on the front line.</p><p>Yes, about one and a half months have passed on painkillers.</p><p>Separate battalion of terroborons led by combat Oleg Cherkashin<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/08/09/bagatopoverhivky-skladalysya-niby-kartkovi-kombat-ispanecz-pro-boyi-na-harkivshhyny-ta-v-bahmuti/">went out</a>From Bakhmut the last - they kept the defense of the city.</p><p>They left in the morning, barely engaged in the morning star. The "path of life" the enemy is mercilessly curved with shells. Along with the car in which Timur sat, a mine was a pickup. Part of the path had to overcome - with a sick limb and a full medical backpack: the man did not want to leave the invaders either pills or syringe. Fortunately, the exit has passed safely ...</p><p>After the fighting for the Fortress City, the Troy battalion was sent to Sumy region. Already there, "Balu" occupied the position of a mouthful physician. Together with their colleagues, they set up cooperation with the local outpatient clinic - many after fierce fighting had health problems that had to be solved here.</p><p>The pain in the knee, and later in the hip joint, were exacerbated: Timura no longer took even serious painkillers. When the man turned to experts, the verdict turned out to be disappointing-necrosis of the hip joint began, and endoprosthesis required.</p><p>A few months ago, the man was operated on. The Military Medical Commission found Timur unsuitable. Last October, he completed his military service.</p><p>Currently, the ball is undergoing rehabilitation and helps brothers on a volunteer basis - the war with the Russian aggressor continues, we will rest then…</p><p><em>Photo from the hero's archive</em></p><p></p></div>
