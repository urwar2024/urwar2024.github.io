"20 days in Mariupol", recognized as the best in the "full -length documentary" category. The tape tells about the beginning of Russia's large -scale war against Ukraine in the capital of the Azov - bombing of residential quarters, maternity hospital, life of ordinary Mariupols in such conditions.</strong></p><p>Receiving this award, the film director Mstislav Chernov emphasized:</p><p>- I will be the first director on this scene, who will say: I would like I never have to do this tape. I would like Russia to never attack Ukraine and never occupy our cities. I would give it (Oscar. - Avt.), So that Russia would not kill tens of thousands of my fellow citizens and released hostages, military and civilians.</p><p>He noted that he could not change the story, but we can all now make the story of the story and make the truth win that the dead of Mariupol and his defenders have never been forgotten. After all, cinema forms memories, and memories - history.</p><p>The correspondent of the Armyinform met with the director of the film Mstislav Chernov. They talked about heavy memories from the occupied Mariupol, dangerous work and world publicity about Russia's crimes against Ukrainians.</p><p><strong>- I know that you are not a journalist by education. How did you happen that you became a media? Why did military journalism and conflict journalism choose?</strong></p><p>- In fact, I often ask myself this question. I am an engineer of computer systems by education. When I graduated from the university, I realized that this is not what I needed at all, not what I want. I took the first steps in journalism at the Mediaport Agency. Then there was a break - I was engaged in documentary. When the Maidan began, he returned to journalism. I would like to say that, starting with the Maidan, continuing the occupation of Crimea, Donbass, all these events, the years of war, have grown generations of young journalists who are trusted in the world. I am one of them. If you look at the state of Ukrainian documentary and journalism until 2013, it was stagnation. And now heales. Unfortunately, there is a difficult reason for this ...</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">"We understood that the capital of the Azov would become the occupiers the main purpose"</h2><p><strong>- Mstislav, how did your team find themselves in Mariupol last year on February 24? Did it happen?</strong></p><p>- Like other international teams, we worked in the Donbass at that time. They went along the front line, removed the Ukrainian military. On the eve of the Great War, the Russians began to increase the number of shelling, and already on the 23rd, it became clear, something else about it. And we decided to meet a new wave of escalation in Mariupol. It is a strategically important city. And symbolic - because here is the location of the Azov battalion, which plays a large role in Russian propaganda. We realized that the capital of the Azov would be the main purpose for the occupiers, so we decided to work there.</p><p><strong>- While in a blocked city, did you expect such a scope of fighting, so many shelling? Did he still look forward to the recurrence of 2014?</strong></p><p>-People who lived in Mariupol,-were just waiting for the repetition of 2014. I think this was one of the causes of the tragedy that happened to the city and its inhabitants. They did not fully understand how quickly Mariupol would be surrounded by how chaotic Russia would fire. I remember talking to the Red Cross, with doctors. Everyone asked us, the journalists, the question: “How will it be? You saw other wars there. " I then told them, "Listen, get ready that there will be something of a thunderstorm or aleppo." These two examples of cities that Russia tried to take and did not manage to do it. And everyone told me, "No, not to panic, it's not true, everything will be normal." Unfortunately, my forecasts have come true ...</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">“We see the best features of humanity - mutual assistance and hope”</h2><p><strong>- Tell us about staying in the blockade Mariupol. Where did you live, how did you survive?</strong></p><p>- It's all shown in the movie. Our life was no different from what happened to the rest of people. They lived in the basements, in the hospital, slept on the floor with doctors and patients. They ate once a day - some kind of canned, died pate; They drowned the snow at the fire to get drunk. They helped carry the doctors with the wounded. But the movie is not about it. There is a journalistic perspective here - I wanted to show how the information field works: how our stories around the world are diverging, how Russian propaganda works, how it responds to certain events; As the lack of information affects people-catastrophically, destructively ... As it affects Ukraine, any modern society. We just became part of this society, and this is another such interesting effect. On the one hand, when panic is sown, we see the worst in society - looting, cynicism. But we also see the best features of humanity - mutual assistance and hope. It is she who goes through the whole movie.</p><p><strong>- That is, such a quintessence of this movie is hope?</strong></p><p>- Yes, I often hear from those who have not yet watched the movie: "I'm afraid to watch the movie because it's too heavy." But those who looked at the ribbon - go out after a session with hope in their hearts, because in the movie we see people who suffer, but these people are not themselves, they are surrounded by those who support them. Every minute.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">As long as the city remains occupied, the evidence of the crimes of the Russians is getting smaller</h2><p><strong>- If you are asked to provide your staff for the Hague Court, will you share?</strong></p><p>- It does not work so much with the Hague court. Video and photo materials, of course, are important for investigations are originals. And it is good that we have taken out the originals - they are combined with dozens of other options and points of view of the investigation: these are experts, witnesses, and satellite images. But the main thing is access to the crime scene and the bodies of people who were killed. If there are no bodies, then the investigation is impossible.</p><p><strong>- No body - no business?</strong></p><p>- Well, you can say so. And every day, as long as the city remains occupied, the evidence becomes less and less - it is the physical evidence of what happened. That is why de -occupation is so important as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>- Your personal outlook has changed after being surrounded by Mariupol? Life values have shifted?</strong></p><p>- No. For me, this war has been going on for the tenth year. 2014 is the moment when the Russian invasion has become part of our identity-personal and national. This is what has become a new course of life for us all.</p><p><strong>- You have visited many ... Can you say that Mariupol has become the most terrible place for you?</strong></p><p>- I do not think that this war is the most terrible in human history, and Mariupol is not the worst that happened during this war. But for me and for the people I worked with, and for the residents of the city it was definitely the worst and worst, the most dangerous, the most traumatic that only could happen. I hope nothing worse with us will be ...</p><p>But at the same time, Mariupol became a victim that we all brought for the sake of seeing the true face of the Russian invaders. Therefore, this is not a vain: now those who were not ready for war - already have an understanding of what evil we have faced.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Why? - It was the main question</h2><p><strong>- And what was the worst there for you?</strong></p><p>- Yes. The horror that happened around. I will not talk about myself now. I made my choice when I came to Mariupol the day before. I had a goal in front of me - to capture everything I see, to pass to the editor, and then let it be. But the rest of the people did not choose this.</p><p>And the feeling of powerlessness and despair: how much do not remove the dead children, they will not be alive ...</p><p><strong>- In these 20 days spent in Mariupol, what main emotion managed you?</strong></p><p>- Anger, apparently… anger that this horror does not stop, that we, as journalists, are unable to stop it, even showing the world. Anger is just that you can't find the answer - why, why?</p><p>The movie has a moment when the family loses the baby. And the mother of this child asks the universe - why, why did it happen? It seems to me that this is the main question, what was there - why?</p><p><strong>- You have found the answer for yourself - why? Or for what?</strong></p><p>- Unfortunately, this question has no simple answer. But at the same time - precisely because there is no answer, it becomes clearer what to do next. We need to go and fight on ...</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">“After I saw, I don't believe in God. I believe in justice ”</h2><p><strong>- They say that there are no those who do not believe in God in the war. What are your relationship with him?</strong></p><p>- After I saw, I do not believe in God. I believe in justice. At least hope for her. I believe in mutual assistance, humanity and that all of the above wins evil.</p><p><strong>- How did you get out of Mariupol? It is a miracle that you were able to even carry equipment and records through checkpoints!</strong></p><p>- It's really a miracle. There are different protocols to do in this case. There were options to leave the materials and leave, there were options to pass on the materials to someone, but we realized that we were threatening this person. Therefore, they decided to take everything on themselves - materials, equipment, hard drive, Tyra card, which at that time was already captured by the Russians. It was the second day of the Green Corridor, filtration as such at the time. So yes, we are really lucky.</p><p>Even after us, our colleague, the Lithuanian documentary Mantas Kvedararovichus, left us - the invaders were shot at the checkpoint ...</p><p><strong>- Mstislav, why twenty days? Not fourteen, not twenty -one? ..</strong></p><p>- We went because the Green Corridor opened. In addition, we simply could not work - the building of the Red Cross was bombed, a hospital where we worked with doctors, captured the Russians, there were neither generators, food, nor water. We also lost the car. And it was extremely necessary to take out the materials ...</p><p><strong>- There is something known about the fate of the movie's characters?</strong></p><p>- Yes, we know almost everyone. Someone died, someone survived ... families who have lost children scattered around the world. The military from the forces of special operations that rescued us from the environment - someone died in Azovstal, someone was captured. We were waiting for their return so that the movie could be released. Some have already returned to the front.</p><p>Police officer Vladimir, who helped us get out of Mariupol and remove the records, was recently wounded during the Pokrovskaya missile firing. He is now on rehab.</p><p><strong>- I guess that it has been filmed for more than one hour of material. But still - how did you choose the frames for the movie? As a journalist I understand that you want to show as much as possible ...</strong></p><p>- It was filmed for about 30 hours ... But not everything he wanted - something did not have time, he hid somewhere, pressed the button somewhere.</p><p>The style of the tape is unusual for Ukrainian documentary, because the first person story goes, and it helps to combine stories.</p><p>With regard to the selection of personnel - a large proportion of this work falls on our mountaineer Michel Master. Her fresh perspective, the fresh look helped me to choose moments, to understand that it would be possible to tell the history of the occupied city, to fully immerse the viewer into that atmosphere.</p><p>We mounted the movie to show that after the twentieth day it was even more scary. It seems to me that this was precisely because we use the principle of a diary in the movie - the day one, the second, the third. So it really was - we all counted the days. And then the viewer sees that the 20th day has passed worse than the previous ones, and probably nothing can be scary, and there was 86 days there-then you can already understand everything with extrapolation.</p><p><strong>- Will you return to Mariupol after the victory?</strong></p><p>- Of course, you need to show the movie in the Drama Theater. In addition, you need to remove a new tape - about return.</p><p><strong>- Do you imagine meeting with the city?</strong></p><p>- It will be another big battle for return. But it is necessary, because the love for the state is born in the struggle.</p><p><em>Photo by the author</em></p></div>
