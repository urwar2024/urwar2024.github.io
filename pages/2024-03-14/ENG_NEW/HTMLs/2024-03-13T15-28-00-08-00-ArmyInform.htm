Before the large -scale invasion, they made exclusive handmade decorations of porcelain and clay in their own studio. There was demand, in particular, in the international market.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitaliy was a pro -Ukrainian activist of Donetsk region: a participant in the Orange Revolution, an activist of Svoboda in Donetsk in 2009. He developed a patriotic movement in Slavyansk after 2014.</span></p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-551085" height="1542" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T15-28-00-08-00/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T15-28-00-08-00/000001.jpg" width="2048"/><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A week before the invasion in February 2022, Vitaliy wanted to get into the army, but had a back disease. He was sent to collect documents. But already on February 24, the man was called and invited to the Armed Forces. He participated in the liberation, in particular, Liman in Donetsk region from the occupiers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ukrainians need to prepare for this war. It is difficult for me to advise how to prepare it psychologically. Apparently, only on the battlefield, when you get into a difficult situation, you can find out whether you are ready or not. But even from a practical point of view, you need to prepare for the front of the front, ” - -</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1445063945716175/posts/3336420596580491/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">A volunteer in an interview published on November 2, 2022.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of October 2022, the husband received a short vacation and went to his wife for a few days to Kiev. Then the couple used the possibility of cryopreservation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- It was the hardest to get a vacation for at least a few days to implement this plan. We both were confident in the correct solution. The lover knew that in the case of the worst, I could only support the belief in the continuation of our common future in our children. Take care, love, nurture, see how they grow, notice their father's features and enjoy it every time. It is an opportunity to embody the future that should be if it was not for a terrible war, ”says Ms Natalia.</span></p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-551086" height="1653" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T15-28-00-08-00/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T15-28-00-08-00/000002.jpg" width="2048"/><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And on November 9, 2022, Vitaliy Kirchach-Antonenko was killed in Swativ. Natalia was already pregnant.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost a month after Vitaliy's death she</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/businka.ua/posts/pfbid0382WK7gWnQmKE6ZyfWLySxVeWcwPYSjhWvMPoQzMA9yswHkQGjFTjVWSpTUGFNczWl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FB's post about the war, the love of a man and a visit to the reproductive clinic and shared her experience.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The widow of the warrior called for reproductive clinics and take advantage of cryopreservation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And on May 19, 2023, she gave birth to a daughter.</span></p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-551088 size-full" height="2048" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T15-28-00-08-00/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T15-28-00-08-00/000003.jpg" width="1152"/><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Please, everyone who knows my husband, Vitaliy Kirkach-Antonenko, congratulate him on what he became a father. Who is in Slavic, visit it and give Vitcatza flowers. He will never be able to hug his little daughter, but Vitaliy was waiting for her. We dreamed of this day, imagined our joy and pride when we can take our first -born. Thank you all who helped us all this time, thanks to your support, these worst half a year we felt care and care -</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/businka.ua/posts/pfbid0KX8HFyaLCcBWKwcownvhvwgmrDvS3QjyxwnFzfM3E9MJokhx9LYbjQdtc8muqhZVl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is on the social network.</span></p><h2><b>“Pregnancy and birth gave strength to hold on to life”</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Pregnancy and birth of a baby are what forced and gave strength to life. You send all the love and care that overflow your heart to common with your loved one. The kid is my salvation for which you learn to reap life, - Ms. Natalia shares.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is one of those who spoke publicly and support the adoption of the law on post -magotal paternity. Yes, they and Vitaly decided that even after his death, she would use his semen and give birth to another child.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The adoption of this law is extremely important for the military families. Finally, you can not be afraid of the ban and count on this opportunity - to give birth to the continuation of your husband, such desirable common children. The war has brought irreparable grief into our families, but we have the opportunity, thanks to this law, to give a new life, - the woman emphasizes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natalia emphasizes that now it is extremely important to "store the gene pool of bold, courageous heroes who went to protect the whole people of Ukraine."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- They stop a cruel enemy at the cost of their lives, and we are all in boundless debt to them. Together with them we lose the future they built in Ukraine. Their children will be able to continue their parents' path - to love their country and its people above all, - the woman notes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natalia Kirchach-Antonenko advises the families of those military who think about cryopreservation, but do not dare, yet take this step.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- A woman can now doubt and then regret. It is better not to close this opportunity. In any case, she will then make the final decision and choose her way. No one knows how the fate will be, but the birth of a baby from a loved one is the opportunity to fight for, not to give up because of fears and fears. Do not close the opportunity to hear how they laugh and see how your children joy. Even in case of irreparable loss, - summarized Ms. Natalia.</span></p><h2><b>Law</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the Verkhovna Rada amended the norm of the law regarding military personnel in terms of ensuring their right to biological paternity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People's deputies adopted the draft law "On Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine on the Preservation of the Gene Pool of the Ukrainian People" as a whole.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The document provides for:</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of death or recognition of a person as dead, his reproductive cells stored in the cryobank are stored free of charge for another 3 years. At the end of this period, their further storage can be paid for by another person, if such was indicated in the order of the deceased about his reproductive cells.</span></li><li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural person whose reproductive cells are stored in accordance with the law have the right to dispose of them in the event of his death.</span></li><li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of use for conception of a child of reproductive cells of a person who has made an appropriate order in case of his death, this person is recognized as a father or mother of a child born in this way,</span></li><li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The will of a person committed and notarized, before the new law on one's own reproductive cells is put into operation, is the basis for the use of supporting reproductive technologies using these reproductive cells.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2023, Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law that allowed state expense defenders to keep their biomaterial in kriobank. This document applies to both Ukrainian defenders and defenders. In the event of injuries related to reproductive functions, they will be able to continue the genus.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, later it turned out that a scandalous amendment was adopted to the same law that from March 2024, frozen military sperm will be disposed of after their death. But the law signed yesterday will allow the storage and use of reproductive cells of deceased servicemen and servicewomen for the birth of children.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Photo from Natalia Kirchach-Antonenko's social networks</span></i></p></div>
