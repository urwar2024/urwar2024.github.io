It was dawn on the Black Sea. Summer of 2023. The solar disk was rolled out of the horizon. The boat with Ukrainian special forces returned from the combat mission at sea. The board was accompanied by a pair of dolphins. The crew was tired, but this fatigue was sweet. Issue - successful, combat mission - accomplished. They managed to do everything at night while the enemy is blind at sea.</strong></p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-550176" height="1875" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T12-16-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T12-16-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" width="2048"/><p>Restoration of control over "Boyko's towers" in the Black Sea is one of the strategically important special operations for Ukraine.</p><p>Drilling gas and oil and oil platforms off the coast of Crimea in the Black Sea occupied in 2014, and with the beginning of a large-scale invasion, it used for military purposes- as helicopter platforms and to accommodate radar.</p><p>Nowadays, thanks to the control of this object by Ukraine, among other things, the grain corridor was established.</p><p>… But who are these people who stand for brilliant operations of Ukraine at sea? Is they scary? What motivates them, what do they dream, what are their values? And how, finally, got into the army, in elite units?</p><p>One of the members of that crew is a fighter with a call sign "sex".</p><p>- I'm a regular machine gunner, - it is modest, shyly lowering my eyes, says Vadim. He is 31.</p><p>And this conversation armyinform is an attempt to reproduce a portrait of one of the "Rex" from the Special Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces. Those who work at sea are at risk of adrenaline - on you, and have an ambitious goal - to step on the Crimea.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Immediately decided for himself that I would not leave the country”</strong></h2><p>Vadim did not plan to be purposefully be a military. When he turned 18, he entered the university, studied for an economist. But in 2013 he went to serve "a stitch" in one of the military units in Odessa. In 2014, the war began.</p><p>- With me it all started - and with me it should end. The war began when I was in the army. Now I was mobilized too. And together with my brothers we have to complete it, - he states without.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-550197 size-full" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T12-16-00-08-00/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T12-16-00-08-00/000002.jpg" width="1500"/><p>After demobilization in 2014, he found work in civilian life. Then, for a large-scale invasion, he worked as a manager of sales department in the online store of a well-known network for five years.</p><p>When 30, he decided to go to work abroad: he made a passport. But as soon as he took the document - in a few days came on February 24, 2022.</p><p>- I immediately decided that I would not leave the country. In the first days of the war he tried to register in three - there were no places. What motivated me? I couldn't sit still. Something had to be done.</p><p>It was mobilized in February 2023.</p><p>I decided for myself that if I can save at least one life, my service in the army would definitely be worth it. I got into the naval forces, on high-speed sea boats, as a machine gunner,-says the warrior.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Working day - by machine gun and on the waves</strong></h2><p>The following was a thorough training, a honing to the perfection of the skills of owning a Browning machine gun, an understanding of the tactical and technical characteristics of weapons and boats on which the crew was to go to the sea.</p><p>Vadim notes that despite the fact that he is in the ranks of the Navy of the Armed Forces, he swims perfectly. But now he hosted his skills - he jumped into the water in the armor and helmet, worked out the removal of protective equipment and so on.</p><p>Sometimes a military working day is 10-12 or even 20 hours for a machine gun on the waves.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-550178" height="1347" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T12-16-00-08-00/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T12-16-00-08-00/000003.jpg" width="1170"/><p>Behind the back in the military - several months of rotation in one of the regions of Ukraine. They went to the Dnieper, performed tasks related to the work of the mobile air defense group: they worked on Shahmed, rockets. He is irony that the "working day" began at 22:00, when enemies were activated.</p><p>Then they started performing tasks in the Black Sea. Nezing his group was engaged in the special unit of GUR MOU. He recalls that he had to spend several days in the sea: both under the scorching sun and in bad weather. There was a case where during the storm the military was overboard - rescued brothers.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-550179" height="2048" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T12-16-00-08-00/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T12-16-00-08-00/000004.jpg" width="2048"/><p>And during one of the outings on the sea, the team got into a powerful storm. The waves reached about 5 meters. And if usual, in normal weather, it takes 40 minutes to get to the shore, then at a time 30 kilometers to the shore were overcome for six (!).</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>“When you step on board the boat, all the experiences, fear and traveling disappear”</strong></h2><p>The first combat mission "Sex" - "Boyko's towers". From the coast of Odessa approximately 120 kilometers, 3-4 hours of course.</p><p>- Boats should be fully loaded - BC, more BC! Fuel - we are refueling on the go, we do everything quickly, mostly under the cover of the night, - the interlocutor emphasizes.</p><p>The first output to the towers is intelligence. Checked the availability of displacement, etc. They came to the object, recalls, rooted. The scouts went to work on the towers. An hour has passed, when Vadim remembers the enemy SO-30, about 500 meters, recalls Vadim.</p><p>— We didn't understand whether the "drying" was ours or not. We immediately began to prepare for battle. Was it scary from the sound of enemy aircraft on the high seas? Only fools are not afraid... But it's scarier more in front of the task, because you don't know what to expect... And when you step on board the boat, all the worries, fear and jitters disappear. What you have been taught turns on in you... Some instincts, basic behavior with weapons. You control the air, you control your sector, perimeter through a night vision device, you see everything! The plane flew over, and literally five minutes later we saw that it had worked on Zmiinyi Island and dropped bombs. It turns out that we were not noticed.</p><p>The first intelligence was successful.</p><p>During the second outing (also at night), the special forces were cutting on the towers two radar, one of them could track the movement of ships in the Black Sea.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-550194" height="999" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T12-16-00-08-00/000005.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T12-16-00-08-00/000005.jpg" width="1500"/><p>- worked with the help of alpine equipment - they lowered them from a height to the boat. I took them on board. And then they found a stock of helicopter ammunition - unmanaged aviation missiles. To lower all those boxes, so that you understand, you need to stairs, almost vertical. One box weighs about 60 kg. There were more than a dozen of them.</p><p>The deadline of special specialty - to do all the work before dawn, to work only at night. In the dark, the enemies are blind. With sunrise, the risks increase.</p><p>- What were the feelings? Normal. Feelings of work done - laughs "sex". And he adds:-During each operation, I have confidence in people with whom I go side by side. Confidence in the commander - "Hummingbird" was able to motivate his own example. If he goes - then you go. Your crew is your family. And you do your job because someone has to do it. And specifically you have to do the maximum.</p><p>We ask whether the military is aware of its role in the strategic operation to return the Boyko's towers under the control of Ukraine. He replies as follows:</p><p>- Everything is natural: first - the cruiser "Moscow" was destroyed, which controlled the waters of the sea. Then the return of the snake, where they destroyed a bunch of enemy equipment. Next - Boyko's towers. It's all about sea control. What's next? Everything is natural - Crimea.</p><p><strong>- Remember, please, your worst, most painful memory during the service in the army?</strong></p><p>- The loss of my commander of the Katery Group. It was the first person I met when I went to serve. A very cheerful guy, we were everywhere together. He then worked in Kherson region. The boat was shot, but he survived, returned without injuries. And then there was an accident. He died. He was only 23 years old. I couldn't put up with it for a long time. Wanted to move to the other part. But then he decided that I had to continue his business to make his memory live. I have to do what we did not have to do with him. I have to return our native Crimea with my brothers.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-550192" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T12-16-00-08-00/000006.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T12-16-00-08-00/000006.jpg" width="1500"/><p><strong>- And the most pleasant memory?</strong></p><p>- Stairs and sunsets at sea, dolphins, which often accompany us ... When they first saw a couple of dolphins, they perceived it as a sign that everything would be good.</p><p>I am glad that people who understand what they are in the army, why they do it ... This optimism is transmitted. And the belief that everything will be good, because you do your thing. And this is such a honey when the task is accomplished, and you feel fatigue, joy, and an incredible influx of endorphins!</p><p><strong>- What would you like to say to civilian Ukrainians? And, in particular, those who have not yet become defense forces?</strong></p><p>- Every day you need to become better. Exercise. To all. The war will not end tomorrow or after tomorrow. We all need to prepare, study everything as possible, prepare ourselves physically. To be interested in military affairs, to take courses in tactical medicine. Many people think that this is all over and we will live as we lived before. But it won't. The war can touch everyone.</p><p><strong>- What kind of combat mission do you dream of?</strong></p><p>- It would be interesting to knock down something. To make 100% confirmation.</p><p><strong>- What will be a victory for you in this war?</strong></p><p>- withdrawing enemy troops and the return of our temporarily occupied territories.</p><p><em>***</em></p><p>P.S.: Presidential Decree Vadim was awarded the Medal for Military Service of Ukraine. He also has a departmental award of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.</p><p>Currently, the boats of the military unit where Vadym serves are taking part in operations to expand the bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnieper and demine the Black Sea.</p><p>"Sex" says that with the onset of spring and the warm season, combat missions will become ... more interesting.</p><p><em>Photo by Vitaliy Pavlenko and from the personal archive of the interlocutor</em></p></div>
