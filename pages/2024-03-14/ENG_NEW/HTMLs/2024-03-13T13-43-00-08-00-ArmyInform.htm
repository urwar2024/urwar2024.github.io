There are a few stories I can tell. For example, in one city, data on the movement of a column of enemy equipment with missiles was sent to Ukrainians the chatbot from almost every apartment on two streets — and the Defense Forces destroyed it at your request," Mykhailo Fedorov wrote.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-551013" height="1080" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T13-43-00-08-00/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-13T13-43-00-08-00/000001.jpg" width="1080"/><p>In another region, people from 9 settlements recorded the movement of a large column of Russian equipment along its entire journey of 100 km. The chatbot received 19 messages with photos and videos of this convoy. And this information also became useful for the Defense Forces.</p><p>Mikhail Fedorov noted that the importance of information from Ukrainians from the occupied territories is equated with satellite images and intelligence data. Each application is processed several support lines.</p><p>On the first - specialists verify information, visually check for logic: whether it is a tank, not a leg or wall.</p><p>At the second stage, the application is analyzed according to the standards of the Ministry of Defense. Next, they decide whether to send it to the Defense Forces. This information allows the military to quickly decide where to strike.</p><p>“The war is ongoing and the need for information remains. Do you live in occupied territories or have relatives there? Report to Evorog (https://t.me/evoroG_bot) about Russian equipment, personnel and collaborators, ”Mikhailov Fedorov wrote.</p><p>Before<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/12/v-ukrayini-pochynayetsya-masove-vyrobnycztvo-nazemnyh-bezpilotnykiv/">The Armyinform reported</a>About Mikhail Fedorov's statement about the beginning of production of land drones in Ukraine.</p></div>
