And, in fact, calls to the authorities of these regions to save the lives of their inhabitants. I think this is a very serious and significant statement, ”the GUR spokesman said.</p><p>He commented on the raid in the specified areas of Russia of RDC, Legion "Freedom of Russia" and "Siberian Battalion", whose fighters are fighting on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine against the Russian occupation army and Putin's regime.</p><p>“Of course, these events are of serious and military importance and political. I think that yesterday, thousands and millions of Ukrainians simply looked at the heroic actions of the RDC fighters, the Legion "Freedom of Russia", "Sibbat", because they show that the one who brings war to another's house will call it.
