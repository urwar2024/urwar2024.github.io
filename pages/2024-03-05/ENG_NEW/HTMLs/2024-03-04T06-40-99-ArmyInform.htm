But it can only be of high quality if the soldier trains a qualified instructor. Therefore, our army pays much attention to the preparation of future instructors - those who will do an iron warrior of the former civilian.</strong></p><p>As the instructors in the Armed Forces of Ukraine are currently being prepared, which countries help us in this and who is the "Rex" in the modern slang of the military, read in the material of the correspondent Armyinform.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">"Introduce a basis of basic level instructors we were helped by Lithuanian colleagues"</h2><p>- Soldiers come to us from their crews to undergo basic level instructors training. We teach their teaching methods: how to properly prepare educational material and training places for classes, how to qualitatively bring information to the personnel, - says Chief Sergeant Olga.</p><p>She is currently responsible for the platoon commander to prepare the base -level instructors. He says that the course of study in the course is 24 days. The military will study Monday to Saturday inclusive, daily for 8 hours.</p><div class="fotorama--wp" data-auto="false" data-captiontag="dd" data-columns="0" data-icontag="dt" data-ids="547256,547257" data-itemtag="dl" data-link="file" data-max-width="100%" data-ratio="1.5" data-size="large" data-width="1500"><div class="gallery galleryid-547240 gallery-columns-0 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-1"><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T06-40-99/000001.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T06-40-99/000001.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl><dl class="gallery-item"><dt class="gallery-icon landscape"><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="150" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T06-40-99/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T06-40-99/000002.jpg" width="150"/></dt></dl></div></div><p>- We were helped by colleagues from Lithuania.

And so they always spoke of us.</p></div>
