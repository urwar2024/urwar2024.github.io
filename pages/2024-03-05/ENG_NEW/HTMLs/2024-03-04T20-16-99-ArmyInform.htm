The main ones relate to the very basic things that the head of the department assured, can be promptly corrected. In particular, it is non -compliance with an electronic queue, the lack of basic conditions for comfortable passage of VLK and not optimized routes.</p><p>The Minister recalled that in order to accelerate the passage of the GDL and make it more convenient, last year a separate package was introduced within the framework of the medical guarantee program, which allows the military to undergo a medical examination in a civilian medical facility with a clearly defined limit. At the same time, Viktor Lyashko recognized, some of the VLK still operates on the basis of the centers, not civilian medical institutions.</p><p>However, other things will not be left out of the ministry's attention:</p><ul><li>Corruption component, such as sorting bribes for taking into account all available diseases and conditions during medical examinations,</li><li>Schemes of illegal crossing men of conscript age across the state border,</li><li>making decisions to give a delay from conscription for health reasons,</li><li>a formal approach to the passage of HR</li><li>the negligence of doctors,</li><li>Problems with the appeal of conclusions.</li></ul><p>“The list can be continued. There are many questions. Not all of the MOH has direct levers of influence, but for our part we will in every way help so that everyone worked in the legal field without exception. To do this, we cooperate with law enforcement. We are in dialogue with military administrations, ”he stressed.</p><p>The head of the department urged to report the violation. This will help you better understand where there are problems and accordingly to react. As for VLK in civilian medical facilities, you can contact:<strong>0 800 60 20 19.</strong></p><p>As reported<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/04/audyt-minoborony-vyyavyv-30-tysyach-turniketiv-yaki-zberigalysya-majzhe-rik-chastynu-vzhe-vydaly-vijskovosluzhbovczyam/">Armyinform</a>, the Ministry of Defense's audit found 30 thousand turnstiles that were stored for almost a year: part has already been released in the Armed Forces.</p></div>
