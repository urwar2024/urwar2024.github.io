Especially I and numerous frontovists could not understand certain events that took place in our government between 1917 and 1920. In many cases, we were surprised by the course of events, and - as we learned - such actions were not always justified by the situation, - he wrote in memories.</div><p>However, it was Pavel Shandruk who had not only been commanded by the brigade of the famous third Iron Division and to go to the title of General-Horown, but also to head the Ukrainian National Committee and become the commander of the Ukrainian National Army.</p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-547559\" height=\"926\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-04T14-18-99/000001.jpg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-04T14-18-99/000001.jpg\" width=\"1266\"/><p>The reasoning of the military, expressed in his 1947, in Geneva, Essays \"Army and Politics\", published in 1959 in New York, Memories of the Army of the Army (\"Arms of Valor\") and other numerous publications not only testify to acute scientific and political publications Mind, but remain surprisingly relevant to this day:</p><div style=\"margin: 20px 0; margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 8px 20px 10px; border: 2px solid rgb(255 222 71); font-size:15px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #ffffff;\r\n\t\">The world has undergone great harm as a result of Russophile tendencies and political myopia of political leaders such as Georges Clemenceau, David Lloyd George, to some extent Winston Churchil.

The origin opened the path to a church career, so after the elementary education, the teenager studied the seminary.</p><p>However, the fate of the priest did not attract a young man too much, so later Pavel Shandruk found himself in police in Kharkiv.

When, in 1940-1941, he worked as a former prisoner of war at German military headquarters, he was talking about purely technical work. He was forced to release from the camp and gladly got rid of it as soon as possible.</p><p>Therefore, until the end of 1944, Pavel Shandruk lived as a private person in Skernevitsa, where he headed a local cinema.

In 1945, when the third Reich was already moving to the inevitable defeat, he was intended to form from the 14th Division of the SS \"Halychyna\" and some other units where Ukrainians served, the Ukrainian National Army (UNA).
