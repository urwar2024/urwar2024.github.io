And another half a meter broth is poured on top. At the same time, it is impossible to do more wider, because trenches will become more vulnerable to shelling. In construction we use geotextile, mesh, board, bars. \"</p><div class=\"fotorama--wp\" data-auto=\"false\" data-captiontag=\"dd\" data-columns=\"0\" data-icontag=\"dt\" data-ids=\"547321\" data-itemtag=\"dl\" data-link=\"file\" data-max-width=\"100%\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-size=\"large\" data-width=\"1500\"><div class=\"gallery galleryid-547314 gallery-columns-0 gallery-size-thumbnail\" id=\"gallery-1\"><dl class=\"gallery-item\"><dt class=\"gallery-icon landscape\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-04T06-30-99/000001.jpg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-04T06-30-99/000001.jpg\" width=\"150\"/></dt></dl></div></div><p>Due to the fact that the trench goes zigzag, the corners are strengthened with additional columns, departments.
