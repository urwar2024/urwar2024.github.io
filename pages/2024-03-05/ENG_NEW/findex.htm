	">Throughout the period of independence, I was a soldier of the anterior land, far, undoubtedly, from the internal political games and not fully aware of the unacceptable political circumstances for Ukraine, and therefore the actions of our higher political circles were not always clear to me. Especially I and numerous frontovists could not understand certain events that took place in our government between 1917 and 1920. In many cases, we were surprised by the course of events, and - as we learned - such actions were not always justified by the situation, - he wrote in memories.</div><p>However, it was Pavel Shandruk who had not only been commanded by the brigade of the famous third Iron Division and to go to the title of General-Horown, but also to head the Ukrainian National Committee and become the commander of the Ukrainian National Army.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-547559" height="926" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T14-18-99/000001.jpg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T14-18-99/000001.jpg" width="1266"/><p>The reasoning of the military, expressed in his 1947, in Geneva, Essays "Army and Politics", published in 1959 in New York, Memories of the Army of the Army ("Arms of Valor") and other numerous publications not only testify to acute scientific and political publications Mind, but remain surprisingly relevant to this day:</p><div style="margin: 20px 0; margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 8px 20px 10px; border: 2px solid rgb(255 222 71); font-size:15px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #ffffff;
	">The world has undergone great harm as a result of Russophile tendencies and political myopia of political leaders such as Georges Clemenceau, David Lloyd George, to some extent Winston Churchil. We remember that they buried Ukrainian freedom and created Bolshevik authorities. &amp; lt;… &amp; gt; Despite the proclaimed idea of the right of nations to self -determination, the Ukrainian nation that has drowning in the blood was denied material, technical and even medical care.

When, in 1940-1941, he worked as a former prisoner of war at German military headquarters, he was talking about purely technical work. He was forced to release from the camp and gladly got rid of it as soon as possible.</p><p>Therefore, until the end of 1944, Pavel Shandruk lived as a private person in Skernevitsa, where he headed a local cinema. Watching the activities of Ukrainian social and political figures in the Nazi occupied by Europe, he himself removed from any active cooperation with the Nazis.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-547577" height="1152" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T14-18-99/000009.jpg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T14-18-99/000009.jpg" width="770"/><p>It is rightly believed that cooperation with the Germans will look at the best unclear, Pavel Shandruk only agreed after long hesitation at the end of 1944 to head the Ukrainian National Committee in Weimar. The military managed to persuade the military of the UNR to exile Andiy Livitsky, who called Pavel Shandruk to take care of the fate of the Ukrainian soldiers who fought on the side of the Germans and who, in the event of Germany's defeat, could not be given to the Soviet Union in any case.</p><h2><strong>“It was necessary to take feverish measures,<br>To make the division not be issued to the Bolsheviks ”</br></strong></h2><p>Since then, Pavel Shandruk has returned to active political activity. In 1945, when the third Reich was already moving to the inevitable defeat, he was intended to form from the 14th Division of the SS "Halychyna" and some other units where Ukrainians served, the Ukrainian National Army (UNA). In fact, it was to become a revived army of the Ukrainian People's Republic.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-547578" height="1007" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T14-18-99/000010.jpg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T14-18-99/000010.jpg" width="649"/><p>At best, the purpose of the UNA was to continue the struggle for independent Ukraine after the defeat of Germany. In the worst, Pavel Shandruk hoped to surrender not before the Soviet troops, but in front of Western allies on the anti -Hitler coalition, in which Ukrainian soldiers could count, if not compassion, at least for understanding and justice.</p><div class="IOAIO_blockquote"><blockquote class="_iaomo90"><p>"It was necessary to take feverish measures so that the division would not be issued to the Bolsheviks," he wrote in his memoirs.</p></blockquote></div><p>This was done in May 1945 in Austria, where UNA soldiers fired weapons in front of British and American troops. So, going to forced cooperation with the Germans at the final stage of the war in Europe, Pavel Shandruk fulfilled a noble mission, saving tens of thousands of lives of Ukrainians from the inevitable massacre that was waiting for them in the USSR.</p><h2><strong>A Difficult Choice for a Noble Purpose</strong></h2><p>As we can see, during the Second World War, the fate of Pavel Shandruk was not easy, having undergone stunning changes and ending with a forced military-political collaboration with Nazi Third Reich.</p><p>However, his choice was dictated by the sole noble purpose - the desire, if not restored Ukraine's independence, at least to save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-547581" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_547581" style="width: 807px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-547581" height="1120" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T14-18-99/000011.jpg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T14-18-99/000011.jpg" width="807"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-547581">Yaroslav Serednitsky's books about Pavel Shandruk</figcaption></figure><p>If it does not justify the fact of collaboration, then at least acceptable explains it. At least, Western allies treated Pavel Shandruk and the Ukrainian National Army soldiers. Initially, most of them were in the camp for interned near the Italian city of Rimini, and in 1947 they were given the opportunity to settle in the UK.</p><h2><strong>On emigration in the postwar years</strong></h2><p>Pavel Shandruk himself emigrated to the United States in 1948, where he actively participated in the activities of Ukrainian veterans and public organizations, published in Ukrainian periodicals an article on the history of the Ukrainian army and wrote a book of memoirs "The Army of the Twig".</p><p>For the scientific services of the military elected a full member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in emigration on the recommendation of the Taras Shevchenko Scientific and Philosophical Section.</p><p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-547583" height="2048" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T14-18-99/000012.jpg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T14-18-99/000012.jpg" width="1536"/>General died on February 15, 1975 in Trenton, buried in the Bund Broost cemetery in New Jersey.</p><h2><strong>War and Politics: The right reasoning of Pavel Shandruk</strong></h2><p>The fate of Pavel Shandruk was not easy. He had to serve in the armies of different states and in different political regimes, agree to cooperate for political reasons and sacrifice his own security and partly a good name for the highest purpose.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-547586" height="1096" loading="lazy" src="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T14-18-99/000013.jpg" srcset="../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-04T14-18-99/000013.jpg" width="800"/><p>However, despite all beyond any doubt, his figure deserves a fair assessment and respect for contribution to Ukraine's struggle for independence in the twentieth century.
