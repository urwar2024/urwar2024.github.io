Photo: Bae Systems</figcaption></figure><!-- .post-thumbnail --><p><strong>Pentagon has announced that Bae Systems Land and Arments LP received a modification of a contract for the purchase of armored multi -purpose machines (AMPV) for the US Army worth $ 754.3 million.</strong></p><p>As<a href="https://defence-blog.com/bae-systems-nabs-754m-to-procure-ampvs-for-army/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reminds</a>The Analytist of Defense Blog Colton Jones, AMPV has been designed for the US Army as a replacement of outdated M113 machines known since the Vietnam War, reports the Armyinform.</p><p>The works will be performed in York, Pennsylvania, with an indicative date of completion of February 28, 2027.</p><p>The program is essential for the future armored unit (ABCT) combat group and will execute the US Army Strategy for protection, mobility, reliability and operational compatibility. AMPV will be integrated with ABCT and will work with M1 Abrams and BMP M2 Bradley.</p><p>The US Army has identified AMPV with its priority for the safety and survivability of soldiers, which meets the stringent requirements of personnel protection. Ampv uses aspects of Bradley infantry fighting machine and M109A7 self -propelled howitzer, facilitating the community in the ABCT vehicles.</p><p>In August 2023, the Pentagon concluded a full production contract with BAE Systems to continue the issue of AMPV (FOV) vehicles at a high and constant pace. Ampv Fov has five multi -purpose options, including general purpose machines, mortar machines, command machines, treatment and medical evacuation machines.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-561196" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_561196" style="width: 1280px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-561196" height="663" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T09-11-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T09-11-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" width="1280"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-561196">AMPV -based machines.

In this case, it is about armored vehicles that should replace the well -deserved M113 as part of the US Army armored groups. Now the same M113 occupies approximately 30% of all armored vehicles in each of the armored groups of the US Army, ” -<a href="https://defence-ua.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Detailed</a>Some details of this Pentagon project specialists with ICC Defense Express.</p><p>But for the sake of them, they noted that in the case of AMPV it is actually about a heavy armored personnel carrier, created on the basis of BMP M2 Bradley, and which repeats the layout of this infantry fighting machine.</p><p>If more than the characteristics, AMPV is higher than M113 levels of armor protection, the battle mass is 34-36 tons, the crew-2 people, the landing-up to 6 people, the speed-up to 61 km/h, engine power-600 horsepower.</p><p>“It was primarily planned that AMPV would be made in five versions. But some time ago, Bae Systems also presented low -range SACs on the basis of AMPV, ”DEFENSE Express experts added.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bae Systems Concern<a href="https://www.baesystems.com/en/article/bae-systems-showcases-latest-armored-multi-purpose-vehicle-prototype-at-ausa-global-force" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presented</a>Another new version of the AMPV universal caterpillar platform, which the developer positions as "further evolution of the M2A4 Bradley BMP." This time it is made in the configuration of the infantry fighting machine.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-561199" height="672" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1195px) 100vw, 1195px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T09-11-00-08-00/000002.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T09-11-00-08-00/000002.jpeg" width="1195"/><p>Ampv has received a new modular upper body called Exmep (External Mission Equipment Package), which allows you to integrate different types of equipment and tower systems in the form of a Turel that requires human presence and deserted.</p><p>In the presented version, the machine is equipped with a deserted tower under the designation of UT30 from Elbit America. BMP is armed with an automatic MK44S 30 mm caliber gun, a 7.62 mm machine gun and a spike bunch.</p><p>“AMPV in BMP can replace M2 Bradley both in export markets and in the US Army, although the Pentagon has hopes for the promising XM30 BMP. Bradley is impossible to bring Bradley to AMPV, although it is created on their basis because the new machine is available from scratch, which is associated with serious changes in the design of the case and the use of new materials, ”said Bae Systems Darby Dima communications manager.</p><p>The manufacturer also added that AMPV in the BMP version can also serve as a heavy infantry fighting machine in the case of completion of the main modular armor, which can be enhanced by dynamic protection.</p><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb4bIdiD2UA?feature=oembed" title="AMPV: C-UAS Prototype Live Fire Demonstration" width="640"></iframe></p><p>Ampv in the BMP version during combat firing.
