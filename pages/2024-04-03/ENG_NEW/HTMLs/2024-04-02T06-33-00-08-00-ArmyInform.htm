It was not possible to do this before - for a few weeks the CCC was denied because of the excessive influx of volunteers and the desire to select among them, first of all, those who already had combat experience or at least passed military service.</strong></p><p>The novel did not serve in the army earlier, so he only managed to join the protection of Ukraine with weapons in his hands only after persistent attempts a month after the start of a large -scale invasion.</p><p>The lack of experience has not interfered with a motivated defender-now the novel is already a younger sergeant of the 22th separate mechanized brigade, has a successful experience of combat missions, authority and respect among brothers and commanders.</p><p>He tells the awarding of the Golden Cross from the Armed Forces Commander -in -Chief of the Armed Forces, he tells a restrained one - he says that his main achievement considers the successful fulfillment of the tasks, and especially the fact that all the group fighters under his leadership are always returning alive.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-562005" height="960" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T06-33-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T06-33-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" width="1280"/><h2>Rode to the base, and tanks went towards</h2><p>35-year-old novel from the village in the Chernihiv region. After graduating from the Kiev Professional Lyceum of Water Transport, he worked as a driver, becoming a real dual professional. He married, has two children - son and daughter.</p><p>The Great War broke into his life when he was at home, preparing for a trip to Finland - the truck was already loaded and ready for the flight. Early in the morning of February 24, 2022, the novel called the boss, ordered to go to the base urgently. This call became the point of reference between peaceful life and war.</p><p>- It was about five in the morning. When he moved along the route, our tanks went towards the border with Belarus, explosions. Then I realized that it was not a joke - a real Great War began.</p><h2>Grateful to instructors for preparation</h2><p>Even then, the novel decided that he would be involved in the Defense Forces of Ukraine. It was only a month later to embody this desire - the man was denied for a long time, although he went to the shopping center for several weeks almost daily.</p><p>- I was not taken at first. It was explained that only those who have already served and participated in the ATO and OOS participated. But I asked everything and after all I managed to take me in a month. Next was a "teach", - says Roman.</p><p>The preparation, the novel recalls, was intense and was extremely useful. The resulting base was sufficient to accomplish the task, improving their knowledge, skills and combat skills. Therefore, the fighter's instructors mention the instructors with deep gratitude.</p><img alt="" class="vimg alignnone wp-image-562006 size-full" height="1280" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T06-33-00-08-00/000002.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T06-33-00-08-00/000002.jpeg" width="960"/><h2>When to the enemy 10 meters ...</h2><p>Already in June 2022, Roman went to defend Ukraine in the east. At the same time he gained his first combat experience. It was necessary to fight with the enemy at the "zero" in the meadows - the occupiers were nearly 10-15 meters.</p><p>- The ten -meter distance is very close, almost close. We saw them, they saw us. It was possible to call with enemies, even to see their faces, - the fighter recalls.</p><p>The hot summer of 2022 was the time of novel baptism. Fighting in Sands, Spartak, Severodonetsk, Lisichansk hardened warriors and, despite the pain of the loss of brothers, convinced that the enemy was not almighty, it can be destroyed and won.</p><h2>The Golden Cross is a reward for preserving the lives of brothers</h2><p>High responsibility, hard work on self -improvement and the gaining combat experience allowed the novel to first become a senior group and subsequently led to the title of a junior sergeant. The soldiers were entrusted with complex tasks, the perfect performance of which was awarded with encouragement and awards.</p><p>One of the highest of them was the "Golden Cross" - the honors of the Commander -in -Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which awarded the persons of the ordinary and sergeant (sergeant) composition for the manifest courage and successful completion of tasks during the battle.</p><p>The novel remembers the award restrained, claiming that he did not make anything extremely heroic - he simply performed combat missions and always did his best to make all the fighters of his group return alive.</p><p>- All the brothers from the groups that I drove returned alive. I always have two goals - to fulfill the task and at the same time save the life of the fighters. Only then can we assume that everything has been successful, - explains the junior sergeant.</p><img alt="" class="vimg alignnone wp-image-562007 size-full" height="1070" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T06-33-00-08-00/000003.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T06-33-00-08-00/000003.jpeg" width="828"/><h2>The senior group can be harsh but the fighters are grateful for that</h2><p>To do this, the senior group should be as concentrated, collected and responsible as possible. Sometimes you have to be strict to brothers, demand a quick clear execution of orders, and even sometimes thrust one of them during the battle.</p><p>- For the first time they fall under fire, newcomers sometimes fall into a stupor, can get lost. Then you have to respond instantly - to shout at the fighter, push him to react and find shelter, - says Roman. - However, as a result, the brothers are always grateful for science, because they understand that it saves their lives.</p><p>Subsequently, the trained fighters adapt and already begin to act in battle as competently and effectively without unnecessary instructions from the senior group. Then not only he insure them, but they also cover it. The fighters begin to understand each other with half a word, gesture or look, and the group acts as a single coordinated body.</p><h2>The fraction of a second and trident kept from the shot</h2><p>The defender recalls how the ability to rapidly evaluate the situation and make the right decisions helped his group save the life of a fighter, who survived for 46 days in the rear of the enemy and then accidentally went to his own. About this incredible story of a desperate struggle for the life of a soldier<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/01/21/46-dniv-v-tylu-voroga-istoriya-tyhona-yakyj-potrapyv-v-otochennya-i-vyzhyv-bez-vody-i-yizhi/">She told</a>Armyinform.</p><p>-This is our group noticed him when he came out of his hole. I thought that Katsap, I was already prepared to shoot. But then he saw a trident on his cap on his hat and realized that it could be ours.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-562009" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_562009" style="width: 1125px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-562009" height="621" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T06-33-00-08-00/000004.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T06-33-00-08-00/000004.jpg" width="1125"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-562009">Vladimir "Tikhon" Hoodim</figcaption></figure><p>The novel does not hold back emotions, because from the decision to press the trigger, it separated a piece of second. It, however, was enough to call the fighter instead of a shot, ordering him to slowly approach him.</p><p>Then there was a grueling evacuation when, in order to bring out "Tykhon" for their own, I had to overcome about 8 kilometers in the mud in the rain. At the same time, the fighter, the novel emphasizes, was decent, tried to go to his own.</p><p>- It was December 2023, then there were heavy rains, on Berza mercilessly stuck dirt - it seemed that kilograms of 5 additional for each leg. We were exhausted after being in a position without rest. Tikhon understood it and helped as he could.</p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-562010" height="1024" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T06-33-00-08-00/000005.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T06-33-00-08-00/000005.jpeg" width="960"/><h2>Prevent new occupiers' crimes is the main goal of the defender of Ukraine</h2><p>The history of Salvation "Tikhon" is only one of the episodes of the grueling and dangerous combat work of the group headed by a junior sergeant Roman. As a question that prompted him to go to the army and motivates now, he replies:</p><p>- I saw a lot of videos from Bucha, from other cities of Ukraine, from villages in Chernihiv region, which were under occupation. He saw terrible crimes committed by Russian invaders. Let everyone watch these videos and think that if we do not stand here in defense, then this horror can come to them home.</p><p>This is a convinced defender, cannot be allowed in any case, so all Ukrainians should help defend our country as much as possible. Men should be ready to join the forces of defense with weapons in their hands.</p><p><span style="color: #808080;">Photo from the personal archive of the hero</span></p></div>
