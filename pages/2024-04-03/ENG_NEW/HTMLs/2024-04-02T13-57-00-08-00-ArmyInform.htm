And a sense of predictability of all global relationships. Every potential aggressor should know what awaits him if he destroys peace. Justice is able to provide it, ”said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p><p>The President reminded that two days ago he had visited Bucha, a city that had become a symbol of Russian evil for the whole world.</p><p>“You all remember what was on Bucha's streets when the Russian invaders were expelled. Remember how many bodies of killed people are left there. Remember when we started finding mass burials of tortured Ukrainians, ”said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p><p>The President stressed that it is necessary to go a big way so that everyone who then came to Russian power after Putin knew that justice was stronger than the Kremlin's walls.</p><p>He noted that the conference aims to summarize the progress in investigating Russian war crimes and in coordinating international efforts for justice.</p><p>“We must do everything possible for the sake of justice, so that justice gives the true power of our common security - security from Russian aggression and terror. And let anyone who destroys peace is really afraid to be on the dock in the Hague, ”the Head of State emphasized.</p><p></p></div>
