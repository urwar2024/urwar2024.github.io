That is why they try to press on deeper regions of Ukraine, not just on the frontal areas, ”Natalia Humeniuk explained.</p><p>She noted that the defense has information about the number of land systems and track their maneuvers. And the signals of air anxiety associated with the threat of ballistics are a consequence of this activity.</p><p>As for the situation in the Black Sea, the spokeswoman said that hostile rocket launchers were equipped and brought to base points.</p><p>“In principle, their readiness is very high: 2-3 hours are enough for them to be on combat duty. We have already seen that during the preparation for massive attacks, the enemy removed underwater rocket launchers to duty, ”said Natalia Humeniuk.</p><p>She also added that the Russians could accumulate a fairly powerful potential of the caliber missiles and it is likely that after changing the leadership of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation will find ways to regain positions at sea.</p><p>"It should not be forgotten that they are capable and on a fairly insidious step - an attack from a bay," Natalia Humeniuk emphasized.</p><p></p></div>
