The easiest way is if the family lives together. Then it is enough to add a copies of marriage and birth certificates to the release report.</p><p>If the serviceman is divorced but the children live with him, the court's decision to dissolve marriage and determine the residence of the children with the father is required. Or the decision of the guardianship authority to determine the residence of children with the father.</p><p>If the children do not live with their father, the court's decision is required to appoint to pay child support. As well as a certificate from the executive service that the serviceman has no debt to pay alimony.</p><p>Also, if any, you need to add a large parent's certificate.</p><p><strong>There is no such option for contract service for servicemen.</strong>However, this may change. Currently, the Parliament is being considered by the draft mobilization, adopted in the first reading. Among other things, it is assumed that the grounds for termination of the contract and further release during the martial law may be family circumstances or other valid reasons.</p><p>The list of such circumstances contains: "staying on a serviceman of three or more children under 18 years of age, except those who have a debt on payment of alimony, the total amount of which exceeds the amount of payments in three months."</p><p>That is, if these points do not make changes, then after the adoption of the bill the opportunity to be released through the maintenance of three or more children will also appear in contractors.</p><figure class="kg-card ai-readalso-card"><a class="ai-readalso-container" href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/12/07/yak-zvilnytys-z-vijskovoyi-sluzhby-za-simejnymy-obstavynamy-rozyasnennya-mou/" target="_blank"><div class="ai-readalso-content"><div class="ai-readalso-title">How to release from military service under family circumstances: clarification of MOU</div></div><div class="ai-readalso-thumbnail"><img alt="Як звільнитись з військової служби за сімейними обставинами: роз’яснення МОУ" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T06-54-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-02T06-54-00-08-00/000001.jpeg"/></div></a></figure><p>Currently, many servicemen who have three or more children are served in the defense forces of Ukraine.
