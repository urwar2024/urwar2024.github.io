<h2>Zelensky总统：关于今天的新闻报道之一。 总理Scholz告诉他将打电话给普京。 在我看来，奥拉夫的电话是潘多拉的盒子。 现在可能还有其他对话，其他呼叫。 只是很多话。 这正是普京很长一段时间以来想要的：削弱他的孤立对他至关重要。 俄罗斯的孤立。 并进行谈判，普通的谈判，这将一无所有。 就像他已经做了数十年。 这使俄罗斯在其政策中没有任何改变，无需做任何实质性的事情，最终导致了这场战争。 我们现在了解所有这些挑战。 我们知道如何行动。 我们想警告大家：不会有Minsk-3； 我们需要的是真正的和平</h2><div class="popup_video"><label><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="337" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://livemapmedia.com/v/#V_Zelenskiy_official_12424" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="600"></iframe></label></div><label><img alt="President Zelensky: Regarding one of today's news stories.
