At the same time, during the martial law, the time of service in the previous rank is much smaller than it would be in peacetime. In particular, the following terms of service in the military rank have now been set:</p><ul><li><strong>1 year</strong>-for the junior and senior sergeant and sergeant (junior sergeant, sergeant, senior sergeant, chief sergeant, headquarters), junior officers (junior lieutenant, lieutenant, senior lieutenant, captain);</li><li><strong>2 years</strong>-for the highest sergeant and sergeant (master-stateant, senior master-assistant, chief masterpad), senior officers (Major, Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel).</li></ul><p>But even if you have served in your rank set deadlines, the rank also requires a position that provides a military rank higher than what is present at this time. That is, if you are a younger lieutenant, and you are in a position on which the older lieutenant should be on the staff list, then you can get the next title. If you are already a senior lieutenant, then there will be no increase in the rank in this position.</p><p>The regular military ranks can be obtained ahead of schedule. In particular, in order to encourage command. This implies<a href=\"https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/551-14#n12\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Law of Ukraine \u201cOn the Disciplinary Statute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine\u201d</a>. At the same time, if earlier early assignment was possible only once in the entire period of service, then in the title of major this can be done twice.</p><div class=\"mIOAIO_blockquote\"><blockquote class=\"_miaomo90\"><p>\u201cDuring the period of martial law or repel of armed aggression against Ukraine, promotion in the form of early assignment of the next military rank can be applied to the servicemen .</p></blockquote></div><h2>Cases in which military rank is not assigned</h2><p>In addition to the fact that the regular title may not be given in the case of official restrictions, there are also other factors.</p><p>In particular, if a serviceman is used disciplinary punishment - a warning of incomplete service. Either a court sentence is imposed not related to deprivation or restriction of liberty, arrest, detention in a disciplinary battalion, or exemption from serving a sentence with a test.</p><h2>Degradation in rank or at all deprivation</h2><p>The lowering in the military rank can also be as a disciplinary penalty. In this case, the decrease goes one degree for Sergeant and Chiefs of Sergeant, as well as officers. Exception for junior sergeants and junior lieutenants. This penalty is 1 year. But after the expiration of his validity or early removal in the previous military rank, the serviceman is not renewed.</p><p>They may deprive the military on a sentence of court in connection with conviction for committing a serious or particularly serious crime. Such servicemen are excluded from the lists of personnel of the military unit. And the territorial centers of staffing, which take such servicemen on registration, assign them to the military rank of a soldier of the reserve.</p></div>", "source": "https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/20/yak-mobilizovanomu-otrymaty-vijskove-zvannya-dostrokovo/", "title": "How is a mobilized to get a military rank ahead of schedule", "description": "The Armyinform tells when and what titles are granted, why they may not be assigned ...", "author": ["Army Inform"], "categories": ["\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438", "\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0456\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0445\u0438\u0441\u0442"], "tags": ["\u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0456 \u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f", "\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430", "\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0456\u043b\u0456\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044f", "\u0420\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442", "\u0441\u043e\u0446\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0438\u0441\u0442"], "source_name": "ArmyInform"}
