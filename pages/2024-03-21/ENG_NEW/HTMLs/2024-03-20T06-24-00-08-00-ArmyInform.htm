He manages to convey them as artists can only:</p><p>- On the one hand, it is an animal fear, a sense of self -preservation with your eyes involuntarily looking for a place where to hide, where to go. But at the same time-the willpower, our Ukrainian stubbornness, is pursued: you eventually decide to fight the last ...</p><p>The man tells that at times it seemed that the Ukrainian land became a continuous hell - this is the end, from this forest you would not come out, it is the last day of your life:</p><p>- But you come back.

His unit fought for a mite. Angnded by previous failures, the enemy did not allow you to approach positions, did not allow to equip trenches - "crown" from everything that was in service. So they had to hide in the "burrows", which were dug by the Russians.</p><p>The Army says that the enemy FPV-drones, which were in the sky of Donetsk region, were especially presented, and mortars who worked for a continuous one:</p><p>- The orcs put their pieces five in one place - until one is charging, the other shoots. And it lasted for hours. And they did not even try to storm - they just used the tactics of "burned ground".</p><p>But despite the prevailing forces of the enemy, the Ukrainian units were constantly trying to knock out the occupiers from the village. Several times the "Space" mouth was stormed - the boys returned to the wounded, many fell on that piece of Ukrainian land, but they completed the combat mission - Tickyivka is still under the control of Ukrainian forces.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-553199" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_553199" style="width: 1280px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-553199" height="853" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-20T06-24-00-08-00/000004.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-20T06-24-00-08-00/000004.jpeg" width="1280"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-553199">Photo: Oksana Ivanets / Armyinform</figcaption></figure><p>Even in the most difficult battles, Vladimir does not forget about art - for combat outputs, the man takes the GPRO camera and films everything that happens around - both for history and for the Hague court, where they will surely judge the Putin regime.</p><p>In collaboration with informal cinema association Babylon`13 was created<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqs2cueD2k4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The War-Nanager Project</a>.
