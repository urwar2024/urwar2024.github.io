Sweden will now take her right place at the NATO table with an equal voice regarding the formation of NATO policies and decisions. After over 200 years, Sweden already has the defense of Article 5, a decisive guarantee of freedom and security of the Alliance. Sweden has brought with it capable armed forces and first -class defense industry. Sweden's introduction makes NATO stronger, gives Sweden more security, and the whole alliance makes it better protected. ”</p><p>Given the words of NATO Secretary General, the Armyinform gathered information, with which the official Stockholm joined the most powerful political-military bloc.</p><p>By its political system, the Kingdom of Sweden is a parliamentary monarchy, which, in turn, has been part of the European Union since 1995, although it continues to use its own currency, the Swedish crown. According to the Central Statistical Administration of Sweden, there are 10 550 054 inhabitants today in the country today. At the end of 2022, this state was elected 865 256 foreigners for their premises. The largest group of foreigners consists of Poles - 56 165 people, followed by Syrians (53 698), Afghans (45 053), Finns (40 227) and Hindus (36 342).</p><p>Like Finland, Sweden is a country with a high defensive culture. For many years, it has developed a high -tech its own military industry. The most famous representatives of it are Svenska Aeroplan AB (SAAB) relating to aviation, Saab Kokums (ships) and two companies that are part of Bae Systems today systems.</p><p>Sweden makes everything:</p><p>- one -engine planes of Gripen fighters;</p><p>- Carl Gustav rifles;</p><p>- AT4 anti -tank weapons;</p><p>- RBS15 anti -ship missiles;</p><p>- Gotland submarines.</p><p>In 2010, Sweden abandoned compulsory military service, but resumed it in 2017 due to the lack of recruits. Now both men and women are called for its implementation. According to Globalfirepower.com, Sweden is ranked 29th in the world military ranking (as<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/01/22/ukrayina-opynylasya-na-chetvertomu-misczi-v-rejtyngu-najpotuzhnishyh-armij-yevropy/">reported</a>The Armyinform, Ukraine in this plate holds the 18th position in the world and is the fourth strongest army in Europe).</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-553674" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_553674" style="width: 2048px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-553674" height="1235" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-21T07-33-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-21T07-33-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" width="2048"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-553674">Sweden's armed forces in Globalfirepower rating.

In particular, in 2024 they amounted to $ 12.04 billion, ie 2% of the country's GDP (in 2023 - about 1.52%).</p><p>As a member of NATO, Sweden must fulfill the obligations made by all NATO members since 2014, and spend at least 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) for defense every year in order to ensure the Alliance's military readiness and restrain any potential attacks, but far away Not everyone adheres to this. And the Swedes are responsible for this from the first year of their membership in NATO. At least 20 percent of the defense budget should be aimed at investing in equipment.</p><p>In addition, Sweden will have to contribute to the NATO civilian and military budget, which will mean about 50 million euros a year.</p><p>Summarizing the overview of the entire defense potential of this country, it should be noted once again that the accession of Sweden, like Finland, was caused by Russia's invasion of Russia. February 25, 2022, the next day after the start of a large -scale aggression, Kremlin<a href="https://twitter.com/mfa_russia/status/1497234734765780997" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">threatened</a>Finland and Sweden "serious military consequences" in the event of their joining NATO. In a few days, demonstrating the seriousness of this threat, Russian aircraft made<a href="https://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/aktuellt/2022/03/ryska-stridsflygplan-krankte-svenskt-luftrum/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">intrusion</a>in the airspace of Sweden with nuclear weapons. These threats had a direct opposite effect from the expected Russian dictator: Finland and Sweden quickly understood the need to seek protection in the Atlantic Alliance.</p><p>"Today's introduction demonstrates that NATO doors remain open and that every country has the right to choose its own way," the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in his welcome speech during Sweden.</p></div>
