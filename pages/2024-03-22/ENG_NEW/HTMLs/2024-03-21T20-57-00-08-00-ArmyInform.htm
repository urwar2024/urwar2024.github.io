You all know what steps you need to take. I urge you to help protect our cities: Kharkiv, Sumy, Dnipro, Odessa, Kherson and others, ”the Head of State emphasized.</p><p>He emphasized that it was necessary to give reliable protection of the sky and over the front in Ukraine.</p><p>"We need to make Putin lose the battle for the Ukrainian sky, and if he does it, he will lose the earth," Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.</p><p>Speaking at the video at a meeting of the Euro Council, the President thanked for the creation of a fund for assistance to Ukraine with a volume of 5 billion euros and for supporting the Czech initiative to purchase shells for our soldiers.</p><p>"The use of artillery on the front is now, unfortunately, humiliating for Europe - in the sense that Europe can provide more, and it is critical to prove now," Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.</p><p>He stressed that it is not necessary to expect Putin to prepare for the Baltic States or other parts of Europe, if you can destroy its aggressive potential now.</p><p>“I hope we can all agree that our Europe needs real defensive self -sufficiency.
