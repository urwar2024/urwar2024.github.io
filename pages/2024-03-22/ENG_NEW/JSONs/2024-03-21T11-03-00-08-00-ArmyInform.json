Mehvod occupies a reclining position on the left, he has a hatch. In the middle</span><span>\u2014</span><span>The gunner, he has no hatch.

On the sides, the thickness of the armor is only 50 mm. Therefore, the tower with all weapons can be affected by a modern automatic gun. In addition, we will add the absence of a visual canal of the commander and the gunner, the inability to provide a circular inspection from the commander's place. But that's not all.</span></p><p><span>According to Sergey Berezutsky, in fact, \"Armat\" \"did not fly\" because</span><span>\u2014</span><span>power plant, transmission, aiming complex.</span></p><p><span>12-cylinder experimental X-shaped diesel with TN A-85-3, it is 2a12-3, it is 12hn15/16, it is 12n360,</span><span>\u2014</span><span>Failed copying of the Austrian Zimmerning engine.</span></p><p><span>Russians developed this engine for about 30 years but never decided the main problem moment</span><span>\u2014</span><span>The engine heat transfer to the tank system simply asks, and the cooling system boils.</span></p><p><span>The problem of creating a modern fuel system with the use of electronic control of the formation of a fuel mixture is not solved (the engine in case of sharp changes in rotation and during starting and heating begins to smoke in the gray-blue spectrum).</span></p><p><span>Difficult to operate. Yes, in order to maintain air purifiers, you need to remove the roof of a motor-transmission.</span></p><p><span>As a duplicate engine created a diesel 12tv373h (\"seagull\"). However, despite the fact that its development was to be completed in 2017, the results were declared unsatisfactory, and the project was closed in the first quarter of 2020 with the wording: \"Production for mass production of the developed engine due to its shortcomings and technically unattainable parameters is inappropriate.\"</span></p><p><span>The Armata transmission is actually borrowed from the GM-569 BUK SAM chassis with the addition of a hydro-500 hydrotransformer. There were problems with electronic brains, which were to ensure uniform operation and stable power transfer. The supply of this system was to make one of the French companies (most likely Renk France S.A.S.), which refused to do so after sanctions after the start of a large -scale invasion.</span></p><p><span>Also, as planned, the guns and stabilization systems were not operated. All Armati shots whose video is available on open access,</span><span>\u2014</span><span>Only from the place. This confirms: the system of armament stabilization does not work.</span></p><p><span>In general, there is nothing in the characteristics of \"Armat\" that could not be implemented on the T-72/90 platform. In fact, the Russians in the best traditions of shows made a kind of \"Potemkin Tank: 2023\".</span></p><p><span>Several specimens are stored in a separate hangar in Alabino near Moscow and used exclusively for parades. On the eve of each event, a factory brigade came to service, which prepared cars for movement without the help of horses.</span></p><p><span>So, if you summarize, there are both advantages and cons.</span></p><p><span>Pluses: a small silhouette of a populated compartment in both frontal and profile planes, insulation of tankers from BC, improved protection from the upper hemisphere (which is especially relevant in the light of the use of drones), a smaller amplitude Machines, the ability to sell a long rollback gun, an unlimited back wall of the tower.</span></p><p><span><strong>Cons:</strong>Reservoir layout, complications of construction, inability to manually dub in case of refusal of the MZ (charging mechanism.</span><span>\u2014</span><span>Ed.), The absence of a duplicate optical channel from sights to operators in case of failure of the electronic canal or damage/failure of power supply.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, the media-spray project, which was to show the grandeur of Russian design thought, was another pollute. Instead of \"Armat\", the Russians began the issue of \"Break-3\", he was T-90m.</span></p><p><span>Developments are ongoing, from time to time, weapons exhibitions appear the latest promising samples of the future tanks, but a number of issues are still needed for their mass production.</span></p></div>", "source": "https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/21/tanky-z-bezlyudnoyu-bashtoyu-chomu-rosijskyj-proryv-vyyavyvsya-pshykom/", "title": "Tanks with a deserted tower: why Russian \"breakthrough\" was a \"poll\"", "description": "So, there is a need to remove the crew from the part of the tank that is most affected and ...", "author": ["Army Inform"], "categories": ["\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438", "\u041e\u0437\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0454\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0442\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0456\u043a\u0430"], "tags": ["FMBT", "\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0456 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0438", "\u0422-90 \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0432", "\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0438"], "source_name": "ArmyInform"}
