Today, it is more difficult for the enemy to form assault groups and this makes it possible for ours to keep the positions more firmly, to gain a more reliable and efficient work on the enemy on the advancing forces, \u201dNatalia Humeniuk said.</p><p>According to her, in order to somehow compensate for the loss, the enemy resorts to the transfer of military units from the East. The parts are brought south, where they are restored on landfills for several weeks, and then they are stormed by the Ukrainian bridgehead on the left bank. So, as they want to go into suicide assaults, the army units are supported by Rosgvardia parts, which serves as such barriers.</p><p>As<a href=\"https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/04/01/na-zaporizkomu-napryamku-vorog-vykorystovuye-otrujni-rechovyny-ta-manekeniv/\">reported the armyinform</a>, in the Zaporozhye direction, the enemy uses poisonous substances and dummies.</p></div>", "source": "https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/04/01/na-livomu-berezi-dnipra-vorog-atakuye-lyshe-pishky/", "title": "On the left bank of the Dnieper, the enemy attacks only on foot", "description": "This was announced on April 1 by the head of the Joint Coordination...", "author": ["Army Inform"], "categories": ["\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438"], "tags": ["\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0446\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043c", "\u0421\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0456\u0432\u0434\u043d\u044f"], "source_name": "ArmyInform"}
