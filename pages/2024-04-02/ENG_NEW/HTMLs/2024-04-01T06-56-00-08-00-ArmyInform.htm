But to defeat the enemy - he needs to know, study, understand his weaknesses.</strong></p><p>Many of this knows the candidate of political sciences, historian, religious scholar, political scientist, officer of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Andriy Kovalev. The military shared his thoughts during a conversation with the correspondent of the army.</p><p>He emphasizes: "It is necessary to look more closely into the words, because the devil is hidden in details." We publish the second part of the interview with the officer.</p><h2>“War must be transferred to the enemy's territory under all circumstances”</h2><p><strong>- Mr. Andrew, what does you mean to win in this war?</strong></p><p>- For me, a victory in this war will be exclusively the collapse of the Russian Federation. The war should be transferred to the enemy's territory in all circumstances.</p><p>And even when Russia begins, there are a number of factors that will still threaten national security. For example, a civil war or a number of civil conflicts in the Russian Federation may begin. This will happen in the immediate vicinity of Ukraine, so it can threaten us. Therefore, one has to think about how to protect yourself.</p><p>Yes, during the collapse of Russia, when it cracks at the seams, Ukraine can also block Ukraine.</p><p>Yes, our country should expect an incredible scale of the migration crisis in the context of the collapse of the Russian Federation. Many of those people "remember" that they are "Ukrainians" and want to return to Ukraine. Therefore, measures must be unambiguously to let these people into the territory of our country.</p><p>During one of the conferences in one of the Baltic States, we were presented with a plan how this country would act in the context of the collapse of the Russian Federation.</p><p>Thus, in Estonia, Finland, the United States already calculate the scenarios of the collapse of the Russian Federation, they have such strategic planning, they know how to respond to it because they have a very high level of national security.</p><p>But in general, I do not see the vision for the collapse of the Russian Federation. Russia is fighting against us for 10 years, but for most Ukrainians of the Russian Federation is terra incognita, they do not know what it is. And Moscow and Russia are a big difference. And Moscow is not all Russia.</p><h2>"Muscovites turned the enslaved peoples into schizophrenics"</h2><p>Russia specializes in the creation of lies brands, one of them is "Union and Independent." But it is not the only one that is to be divided. We need to look more closely into the words because the devil is hidden in details. In the phrase "Russian Federation" the key word is "Federation".</p><p>The federation is the unification of states. The Russian Federation has about 90 objects of the Federation, of which there are 40 national republics. And most are those who, in the early 1990s, declared an act on state sovereignty, and some of them even an act on state independence. Tatarstan and Chechnya, for example, were independent states. And the Republic of Sakh in Moscow is called Yakutia.</p><p>And this is another strategy of Moscow that conquered the territory around him: first, in order to defeat a neighbor, his enemy, he must be replaced, giving him an offensive nickname. That is, not the Ukrainians - but "Khokhli", not Bashkorty - but "Bashkiri".</p><p>There are dozens of such examples. They, for example, were never called "Marians", but called them "cherries."</p><p>Then the people need to be conquered and the elite is either destroyed (if it does not compromise) or to compromise. For example: We do not touch your culture and religion, just show us loyalty.</p><p>Muscovites were used, unfortunately, Orthodoxy as a way of enslavement of peoples, and transformed enslaved peoples into schizophrenics. This is a key strategy of the Muscovites: that the enslaved people with two states, hypostases, with two parallel ego.</p><p>As, for example, the Ersanians. So they said that they would be loyal to the Muscovites, they would go to church on Sunday. But on Monday, they also go into the forest and spend their praying inhpasis, for example.</p><p>Another example - in the center of Kazan the Russian Empire built the Kazan Orthodox Cathedral. It was not a religious symbol, but a monument-Triumph, a symbol of conquest by the Muscovites in the Muslim Kazan of Muslim Tatarstan.</p><p>And the Tatars had a dream: to destroy this temple when they gain independence. And they still destroyed this temple.</p><p>And recently, Muslims in Tatarstan were rebuilt in the center of Kazan at the same place, this cathedral as a symbol that they again express Moscow's loyalty.</p><h2>"Sergei Shoiga Kozhudetovich is a fiction"</h2><p>Russia is a boiling boiler, you know? For a long time, Muscovites have not interfered with the privacy of the residents of the federation. They professed their religion, spoke in their own language.</p><p>But if someone wanted to escape outside the national "territory-reservation", then he had to call "Russian", invent himself Slavic (and in fact-Greek) name, and then could already claim the right to belong to "all-imperial »The elite. For example, the name of Mardvintsev appeared in the Russian Federation.</p><p>He renounced his "I" and the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation. Because Sergei Shoigu Kozhudetovich is a fiction. Just a dude at some point invented the name "Sergei". His name is Shogu, and his name is a shroud, in fact.</p><p>And Patriarch Kirill Gundyaev - Erzinin. Putin - Veps. But now, in the Russian Federation, only about five thousand people are aware of themselves from the once majestic war people. And to be a boar in the Russian Federation, to belong to the people from which Putin comes from, in the Russian Federation is considered "extremism".</p><p>And now, Russia, aware of the potential of enslaved peoples, is trying to fight this national policy: national schools are being closed and so on. The Russian Federation wants to turn everyone into "Russian".</p><h2>"The Cup of Russia will lead Putin elites"</h2><p>I am quite skeptical of national liberation movements in the Russian Federation. If they were, they would have already been in place: they cleaned the Putin regime and so on. Therefore, I believe that the collapse of Russia will be headed by the Putin elites. Yes, the same elites that are now in power in the republics. And as soon as Russia begins to pour - they will be at the head of this collapse.</p><p>Just as the collapse of the USSR was headed by local communist elites, so in the Russian Empire-national liberation movements were led by the collapse of the empire: Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine in the end.</p><p>Do you remember how in the USSR they talked about Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia? "Here is our outgrowth." Because the Soviets did not feel confident there, they went to these countries as a tour - the Baltic peoples emphasized that they were others and that they were in occupation.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Ukrainians did not have time to make such "vaccinations", and we were rolled by genocides, repression, and extermination.</p><p>Ukraine is now as close as possible to be iced in Russia and it begins to fall apart. But not only Ukraine should work on this.</p><p>Let me remind you that the USSR collapsed when this decision was made by American political elites. Yes, the Republicans, led by President Reagan, began to effectively break the USSR, launching this process. But now the American elites have no understanding that Russia needs to be destroyed.</p><p>This must be honestly and frankly saying: partner countries that help us, in particular, in Europe, in 2022-2023, fully financed the war against Ukraine at the expense of their budgets. They purchased goods and energy in Russia at exactly the amount that the Russian Federation spent during this time in the war against Ukraine.</p><p>So, only when there is a political consensus on the collapse of the Russian Empire will it begin to fall apart.</p><p>And they lead this process of Putin elites on the ground, for example, "unicorns". Then they will all begin to say that "from childhood for independent Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, the independent republic of Tuva."</p><h2>“The Tuvintsi national slogan -“ cutting Russian ”</h2><p>By the way, in the Republic of Tuva the highest level of Russophobia in all Russia. Even more than in Ukraine is possible. The Tuvintsi national slogan - "cut in Russian". Believe me, if a white Russian -speaking man gets lost in Tuva - he is likely to be cut.</p><p>In Bashkortostan, it was recently burning - and there was almost no uprising. The topics are environmental: destroying their mountains, wanted to build a fertilizer plant, to produce soda. In Soviet times, one of the mountains was so destroyed simply by leveling with the ground. This time, the Bashkorti came out and defended their mountains.</p><p>In fact, in the root of all national liberation movements, environmental movements are most often in the first place. The Ukrainians also began the movement for the liberation of Ukraine under ecological slogans in the late 80's-in the early 90's, this catalyst was the Chernobyl disaster. In Ukraine, then a political force appeared, called the "Movement for Reconstruction".</p><p>It was an organization of promoting political changes, liberalization in the USSR. And then he began to be called "Movement". And in fact, this movement became a catalyst for Ukraine's declaration of independence. Russia will ripen slowly before.</p><p>Putin is aware of the threat of Russia's collapse, so he tries to capture the subjects of the Federation, the future theoretically independent states, into the war against Ukraine. That is why mobilization in national republics is so active. That is why he gives the national republics defense orders - the so -called defense, in fact - military. In Tatarstan, for example, the Russians built the new plant for the production of drones, and the Tatar elite agreed to these conditions: to fulfill orders, to earn, to participate in the war against Ukraine.</p><p>It should be understood that Ukraine is called what is called the "Russian Federation" is an union of about 90 states. And these are completely different peoples.</p><p>At the beginning of a large -scale invasion of friends, I conducted an analysis of the one who is mostly fighting in the army of the Russian Federation. These are drilling, Dagestan, Bashkir. Why? Because Putin, these subjects of the Federation initially artificially drove into poverty and moneylessness, and then gave them a choice: they can trade on the market, for example, for 5 thousand rubles a month, and can go to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and get 40 thousand rubles month.</p><p>Did you know that the largest number of military units per square kilometer is located in Buryatia? This is a country - a solid military unit. And it was laid in the Soviet time, because Buryatia was a very uncertain country for scoops, the uprisings were afraid here, they could not be conquered for a long time. Therefore, many military units were placed here.</p><h2>“I see the path to a just peace solely because of the disintegration of the Russian Federation”</h2><p>We have to fight. And in no case should there be any surrender. When someone wants to "plow" peace, you should always ask yourself the question: what is the peace?</p><p>The world is different: because of the surrender, with the famous Roman saying "grief", when the winner dictates the conditions of peace. And these conditions can be, for example, mass executions of the Ukrainian intelligentsia; It can be the latest famine, the migration of peoples, genocide. Yes, it can be peace, but what is its price?</p><p>And it may be a just peace. And I see the path to just peace through the disintegration of the Russian Federation.</p><p>It is only after the collapse of the Russian Federation in this part of Europe and in this part of the world prevail. Even if we go to the borders of 2013 and build a very high wall there; Even if, as in Israel, we will create an "iron dome" that will knock down 98% of missiles flying from the territory of Russia - they will be enough for 3-5 years to re -arry, to learn war lessons and return to us with a new war.</p><p>Collective Moskal will not calm down. Even if the political regime changes in the Russian Federation, but Russia will remain within the same limits, with the same harmful imperial habits - we will still have 140 million people infected with bacila chauvinism on the borders. And for them, Ukraine is one big stimulus. They believe that Ukraine's independence for them is injustice, and they dream of the newest USSR.</p><p>The Russians, as in chess, have calculated a lot of steps in advance, laying many "fuses". And the worst of them - that Ukrainians never know anything about Russia. Yes, there are more than 200 peoples and nationalities in the Russian Federation, but Ukrainians will not name even five peoples living in the Russian Federation. So when we try to overcome the enemy, it is first and foremost necessary to know.</p><p>It is impossible to overcome the unknown. The enemy should be made known, understandable, spread into particles. Because so far we are trying to overcome a symptom in this war. But we do not fight the disease. In my opinion, we will win when we start fighting the disease, not a symptom.</p></div>
