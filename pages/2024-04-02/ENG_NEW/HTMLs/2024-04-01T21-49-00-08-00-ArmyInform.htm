But the result remains the same: they lose 60-79 percent of personnel and return to their positions, ”Natalia Humeniuk said.</p><p>According to her, 2-3 storms per day, it is also not enough, especially since the enemy works with storms and artillery in our positions.</p><p>“But when the assault was many times larger, that is, 5-8 storms a day, it was even harder. Today, it is more difficult for the enemy to form assault groups and this makes it possible for ours to keep the positions more firmly, to gain a more reliable and efficient work on the enemy on the advancing forces, ”Natalia Humeniuk said.</p><p>According to her, in order to somehow compensate for the loss, the enemy resorts to the transfer of military units from the East. The parts are brought south, where they are restored on landfills for several weeks, and then they are stormed by the Ukrainian bridgehead on the left bank. So, as they want to go into suicide assaults, the army units are supported by Rosgvardia parts, which serves as such barriers.</p><p>As<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/04/01/na-zaporizkomu-napryamku-vorog-vykorystovuye-otrujni-rechovyny-ta-manekeniv/">reported the armyinform</a>, in the Zaporozhye direction, the enemy uses poisonous substances and dummies.</p></div>
