Participants have distributed tasks and obligations to develop a combat platform, reports the Armyinform.</p><p>A new European tank called MGCS (MAIN GROUND COMBAT System, Ukrainian: The Ground Basic Future Ball system) will be developed<a href="https://www.krone.at/3310930" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">informs</a>Chasopist Kronen Zeitung.</p><p>The project also involves the Italian defense concern Leonardo, which has compiled a strategic alliance with KNDS. Other weapons manufacturers such as Hensoldt are involved in working together.</p><p>Reporters emphasize that all previous delays and differences in the team of tanco -builders were held about which companies and from which countries should participate in the development of a panzernik. The competitor RheinMetall even presented its main battle tank under the code name Panther. However, both the development of MGCS and the German-Spanish invisible fighter (FCAS) is still gaining momentum.</p><p>"This is more than a milestone, it is a historical moment," said Germany's defense Minister Boris Pistorius, speaking with his French colleague Sebastin Lecorton.</p><p>Boris Pistorius said that the agreement includes an agreement evenly distributing industrial volumes between the two countries, "preventing any interpretation or misunderstanding."</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-561097" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_561097" style="width: 1195px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-561097" height="512" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-01T09-11-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-04-01T09-11-00-08-00/000001.jpeg" width="1195"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-561097">Boris Pistorius (right) and Sebastien Lecorton.

Defense News experts<a href="https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2023/09/22/germany-france-eye-new-partners-for-next-gen-tank-in-2024/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a>that a new tank will be a modular platform. The machine will work with or without automated mode. In addition, MGCS will have a certain electromagnetic weapon, electron wrestling and laser weapons.</p><p>However, a new European tank should receive a complex of active protection, protection against drones, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Interest in the Eurotanka MGCS has already been expressed by Italy, the Netherlands and many other countries.</p><p>"MGCS (the main terrestrial combat system), launched in 2017, is a landmark Franco-German weapons program, called the harbinger of a new era of armored vehicles. This ambitious project aims to replace dear German tanks Leopard and the French Leclerc System that integrates the latest technological achievements perfectly. Unlike traditional heavy armored equipment, MGCS is designed as a complex multi -platform system. It includes the main combat tank, equipped with a large caliber gun, and is complemented by a set of interconnected modules: a heavy-armed machine, armed with powerful anti-tank missiles, an original robotic support machine with laser weapons, drones and a number of other innovative weapons.
