It is also important to have uninterrupted supply of spare parts.</p><p>\"For example, spare parts need to be replaced after a certain number of flight hours, not when they have already failed. And if you fly a lot, as it happens in wartime, you need these spare parts. And the problem is not only in money. You have to be sure that these parts will be produced in the right quantity,\" said Rob Bauer.</p><p>Therefore, according to the admiral, it is important not only to think about the training of pilots and technical personnel, but also about the prospects for logistics.</p><p>\u201cAnother important element is weapons for these aircraft. The Dutch government has announced the provision of funds for missiles and bombs for the F-16, other countries are doing so. These are good news, but it will not be easy because different countries give different types of fighters. Therefore, this is a complex question, but I am sure that the Ukrainian armed forces will cope with it, \u201dhe added.</p><p>We will remind, the United Kingdom has announced that the first Ukrainian pilots who have undergone intense training under the guidance of instructors of the British royal Air Force,<a href=\"https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/22/pershi-ukrayinski-piloty-zakinchyly-bazovu-lotnu-pidgotovku-na-f-16-u-velykij-brytaniyi/\">have finished</a>Flight school.</p></div>", "source": "https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/22/topposadovecz-nato-poyasnyv-shho-potribno-dlya-efektyvnogo-zastosuvannya-f-16-v-ukrayini/", "title": "The NATO Top Office explained what is needed for effective use of the F-16 in Ukraine", "description": "NATO Admiral Rob ... said this in an interview with the Armyinform.", "author": ["Army Inform"], "categories": ["\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438"], "tags": ["F-16", "\u0430\u0434\u043c\u0456\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0420\u043e\u0431 \u0411\u0430\u0443\u0435\u0440", "\u041d\u0410\u0422\u041e"], "source_name": "ArmyInform"}
