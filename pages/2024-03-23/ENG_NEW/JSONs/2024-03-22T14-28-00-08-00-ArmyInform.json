But we are looking for technological solutions that are innovative in order to gain a technological advantage on the battlefield over the enemy. And the ammunition that will be provided to us, which we have today, we use with greater efficiency thanks to the best weapons systems provided to us by our partners and the highly qualified training of our artillerymen. Today, on the battlefield, the winner is the one whose shells have a longer range and better accuracy,\" said Ivan Havryliuk.</p><p>As reported by the Armyinform, in the Czech Republic<a href=\"https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/20/u-chehiyi-ochikuyut-shho-pershi-snaryady-v-mezhah-cheskoyi-inicziatyvy-ukrayina-otrymaye-ne-piznishe-chervnya/\">They expect</a>that Ukraine will receive the first shells within the Czech initiative in June.</p></div>", "source": "https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/22/u-minoborony-sprognozuvaly-suttyevu-zminu-u-spivvidnoshenni-boyeprypasiv-ukrayiny-ta-rosiyi/", "title": "The Defense Ministry predicted a significant change in the ratio of ammunition of Ukraine and", "description": "Ivan Havrylyuk made his statement during a live broadcast in the Uniform News Telelorphone 22 ...", "author": ["Army Inform"], "categories": ["\u0412\u0430\u0436\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e", "\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438"], "tags": ["\u0431\u043e\u0454\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438", "\u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u044e\u043a", "\u0441\u043d\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434\u0438"], "source_name": "ArmyInform"}
