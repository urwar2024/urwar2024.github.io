And many NATO countries speak with the United States to provide a help pack. It is not easy to compensate for such a large amount, but the good news is that more and more countries are concluded with Ukraine for long -term support, \u201dRob Bauer said.</p><p>He expressed confidence that, after all, the US assistance package would come because problems in the United States are not related to discussions about whether people want to help Ukraine.</p><p>\u201cIt is about other political things. It is also not saying that there is no two -party support (in the US Congress. - Ed.). And these are good news for Ukraine. Therefore, I hope that all the issues will be resolved and the help package will be provided, \u201dRob Bauer said.</p><p>Admiral added that 50 countries are working in a contact group on Defense of Ukraine, and every month they are increasingly aware that they should do more.</p><p>\u201cBecause the war will continue and will not end soon, and Ukraine should outweigh. We cannot allow Russia to win, \u201dhe said.</p><p>Recall the White House recently announced<a href=\"https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/12/ssha-ogolosyly-pro-paket-vijskovoyi-dopomogy-ukrayini-na-300-mln/\">A help package for $ 300 million</a>, which includes airmarks for air defense and critical for advanced delivery.</p><p>This is the first US assistance package in 2024. It was announced against the backdrop of blocking additional funding in Congress.</p></div>", "source": "https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/22/golova-vijskovogo-komitetu-nato-paket-dopomogy-ssha-potriben-ukrayini-vzhe-na-vchora/", "title": "NATO Military Committee Chairman: US Package is needed for Ukraine as early as yesterday", "description": "NATO Bauer, Head of NATO Bauer Military Committee, said this in an interview with the Armyinform. ...", "author": ["Army Inform"], "categories": ["\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438"], "tags": ["\u0430\u0434\u043c\u0456\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0420\u043e\u0431 \u0411\u0430\u0443\u0435\u0440", "\u041d\u0410\u0422\u041e", "\u0421\u0428\u0410"], "source_name": "ArmyInform"}
