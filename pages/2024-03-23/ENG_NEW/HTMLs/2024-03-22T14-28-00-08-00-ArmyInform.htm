But thanks to the initiative of the European Union, the Czech initiative and thanks to the help packages from other partner countries, I think that in a month or two this difference will be significantly reduced. There will be such a major ratio in favor of the Russian Federation, ”the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine said.</p><p>At the same time, he added that Ukraine does not compete with Russia in the amount of ammunition, instead trying to develop technologically.</p><p>"We cannot and do not seek to compete with Russia in terms of the number of shells, tanks, or soldiers. But we are looking for technological solutions that are innovative in order to gain a technological advantage on the battlefield over the enemy. And the ammunition that will be provided to us, which we have today, we use with greater efficiency thanks to the best weapons systems provided to us by our partners and the highly qualified training of our artillerymen. Today, on the battlefield, the winner is the one whose shells have a longer range and better accuracy," said Ivan Havryliuk.</p><p>As reported by the Armyinform, in the Czech Republic<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/03/20/u-chehiyi-ochikuyut-shho-pershi-snaryady-v-mezhah-cheskoyi-inicziatyvy-ukrayina-otrymaye-ne-piznishe-chervnya/">They expect</a>that Ukraine will receive the first shells within the Czech initiative in June.</p></div>
