"It was an attempt to create the embryo of its national statehood in the bosom of the existing state," Oleg Turiy emphasizes.</span></p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-549825" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_549825" style="width: 781px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-549825" height="500" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-10T13-31-99/000002.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-10T13-31-99/000002.jpg" width="781"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-549825">Meeting of the Main Russian Council, May 1848</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battalion of Russian mountain shooters was created as a volunteer (hunting) Ukrainian (Ukrainians of Galicia were then called Ruthenians) military formation within the Austrian army. Its official purpose was to support the public law and order and the protection of the Carpathian passes to Hungary, where the uprising against the Austrian monarchy raged.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Main Russian Council hoped later to turn the battalion into a purely national Ukrainian armed formation, designed to defend the interests of Austrian Ukrainians. To this end, they created a special commission that took care of the needs of the battalion and planned its further development.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desire to join the ranks of volunteer armed formation revealed 3460 "hunters", from which 1410 soldiers were selected. Initially, the battalion consisted of 6 companies (mouth or hundred), and then the seventh hundred was also formed. The officers' (officers) consisted of not only the Germans but also the Ukrainians, who made up the majority, although they were mostly lower positions.</span></p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-549824" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_549824" style="width: 1000px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-549824" height="690" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-10T13-31-99/000003.jpg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-10T13-31-99/000003.jpg" width="1000"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-549824">The sergeant and shooter of the Russian Guard, 1849</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battalion had unicorn with elements of folk clothing. The uniforms included a felt hat of Hutsul Krysan, a short mountain gray with blue and yellow clamps, red or blue pants.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequently, the form was changed - instead of Krisani, they introduced a blue folding hat with a yellow embroidery and a large board, the gray was replaced with a red uniform with a standing collar, the pants were left blue, with yellow lamps.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the battalion, military symbols were developed, which was to show Ukrainian national character of armed formation. In particular, Sofia Bavarskaya, the mother of Emperor Franz Joseph I, sacrificed for the battalion banner of a dark blue silk ribbon.

At that time, no one has declared it loudly, but it was implied, - Oleg Turiy emphasizes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientist draws attention to the fact that despite the dissolution of the battalion in early 1850, the modern Ukrainian military tradition managed to put strong roots and in the future had an impact on the creation of later Ukrainian military formations.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- It is interesting, - says Oleg Turiy, - that in addition to the Dawn of Halytska, a small brochure was issued, where military teams were first officially submitted in Ukrainian. In this sense, it was the beginning of the Ukrainian modern military tradition.</span></p></div>
