Designed with open system architecture for flexibility, modularity for future growth and compatibility with Himars and MLRS, it acts as a significant asset for further modernization.</p><p>In a good way, the expert recalled that in December 2023, Lockheed Martin reached a decisive milestone by putting the first PRSM for the US Army, increasing the possibilities of the Armed Forces to fire at a long distance.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-549638" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_549638" style="width: 1280px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-549638" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-10T09-11-99/000001.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-10T09-11-99/000001.jpeg" width="1280"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-549638">PUCK PRSM Rockets.

At the same time, the developer then stated that their product would be able to overcome the distance of up to 650 km.</p><p>At the same time analysts of Defense Express<a href="https://defence-ua.com/army_and_war/scho_treba_znati_pro_raketu_prsm_jaku_armija_ssha_otrimuje_zamist_atacms-13759.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a>The peculiarity of PRSM is that it was designed as a "successor" of the MGM-140 ATCMS operative-tactical missile. Accordingly, the existing base - M142 Himars (2 on the starting unit) and M270 MLRS (4 on the starting unit) can be used to start. And even the PRSM itself should be placed in the same starting bags as ATACMS or GMLRS jet shells.</p><p>The open architecture mentioned above gives this rocket great modernization potential. The US Army is already considering its two advanced versions: PRSM Increment 2 with a multi -mode self -wearing system, which is also known as the LBASM Terrestrial Anti -Supervised Rocket, and PRSM Increment 3 with increased combat part while maintaining flight range.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-549640" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_549640" style="width: 1280px"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-549640" height="475" loading="lazy" src="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-10T09-11-99/000002.jpeg" srcset="../../ORI/ArmyInform/Images/2024-03-10T09-11-99/000002.jpeg" width="1280"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-549640">Precision Strike Missile (PRSM) rocket for HIMARS and M270A2.
